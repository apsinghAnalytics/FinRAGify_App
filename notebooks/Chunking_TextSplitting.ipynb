       "[\"Suhasini Chandramouli: Good afternoon and welcome to the Apple Q3 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today is Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\\nTim Cook : Thank you Suhasini. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% from a year ago and better than we had expected. EPS grew double digits to $1.40 and achieved a record for the June quarter. We also set quarterly revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. And we set an all-time revenue record in services which grew 14%. At our Worldwide Developers Conference, we were thrilled to unveil game-changing updates across our platforms, including Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovation and investment in AI and Machine Learning. It will transform how users interact with technology, from writing tools to help you express yourself, to image playground, which gives you the ability to create fun images and communicate in new ways, to powerful tools for summarizing and prioritizing notifications. Siri also becomes more natural, more useful, and more personal than ever. Apple Intelligence is built on a foundation of privacy, both through on-device processing that does not collect users' data and through private cloud compute, a groundbreaking new approach to using the cloud, while protecting users' information powered by Apple silicon. We are also integrating ChatGPT into experiences within iPhone, Mac, and iPad, enabling users to draw on a broad base of world knowledge. We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and we remain incredibly optimistic about the extraordinary possibilities of AI and its ability to enrich customers' lives. We will continue to make significant investments in this technology and dedicate ourselves to the innovation that will unlock its full potential. Recently, we've also been excited to bring Apple Vision Pro to more countries, giving customers the chance to discover the remarkable capabilities of this magical device. Vision Pro users are customizing their own workspaces, watching movies on 100-foot screens, and exploring entire worlds with just a pinch of their fingertips. With more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for Vision OS, the developer community continues to pioneer stunning spatial experiences that are only possible with Vision Pro. Last month, we announced that we're bringing some amazing new immersive content to Vision Pro, including new series, concerts, films, and more. And we've seen great interest for Vision Pro in the enterprise, where it can empower companies large and small to pursue their best ideas like never before. With each innovation, we're unlocking new ways of working, new ways of learning, and new ways of tapping into the unlimited promise of human potential. We are doing that across every product and every service. Now let me share more detail in our June quarter results, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to last year. Customers continue to praise the iPhone 15 lineup for its incredible battery life, exceptional cameras, and unmatched power and performance. And we are excited to bring incredible new features to the iPhone with iOS 18, making it more personal, capable, and intelligent than ever before. This update includes the biggest redesign of the Photos app, new customization options for the home screen, messages over satellite, and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence utilizes the power of our most advanced iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, offering a transformative set of capabilities. Mac revenue was $7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Customers are loving the latest M3-powered 13 and 15 inch MacBook Air. With back-to-school season upon us, MacBook Air is the perfect companion for students on campus and small business owners, developers, and creatives of all kinds depend on Mac to do more than they ever could before. Powered by Apple silicon with its neural engine and privacy built in at the chip level, Macs are simply the best personal computers for AI. And every Mac we've shipped with Apple silicon since 2020, is capable of taking advantage of Apple Intelligence with Mac OS Sequoia. We also know the importance of security for our users and enterprises so we continue to advance protections across our products. Turning to iPad, revenue was $7.2 billion, 24% higher year-over-year. During the quarter, we had an incredible launch where we unveiled the all-new 11 and 13 inch iPad Air, the perfect device for education, entertainment, and so much more. And With the new iPad Pro, we pushed the boundaries of power-efficient performance with the remarkable M4 chip, the engine behind this incredibly thin device. By leveraging the latest in Apple silicon, Video Editors and Musicians can take advantage of the cutting edge AI features in Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro. And we're very excited that iPad Pro and iPad Air models powered by the M series of Apple silicon will be able to utilize the powerful capabilities of Apple Intelligence. In wearables, home, and accessories, revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% from a year ago. Apple Watch is empowering users to live a healthier day with a range of tools to take charge of their wellness journeys. At the core of Apple Watch, are powerful AI features that are helping users get help when they need it most, from irregular heart rhythm notifications to walking steadiness to crash detection and fall detection. I've heard time and again how meaningful these features are for users and their loved ones, and their stories motivate us to keep pushing forward on this vital work. As I mentioned earlier, in services, we set an all-time revenue record of $24.2 billion with paid subscriptions climbing to an all-time high. We achieve revenue records in the majority of the services categories with all-time revenue records in advertising, cloud, and payment services. Apple TV+ productions are delighting audiences on screens large and small. We're sharing powerful works of imagination with series and movies like Presumed Innocent, the Upcoming Disclaimer, and The Instigators starring Matt Damon. And we can't wait for returning fan favorites with new seasons of The Morning Show, Slow Horses, and Severance. Apple TV+ productions also continue to earn accolades with nearly 2,300 nominations and 500 wins to-date. That includes 72 Emmy Award nominations across 16 programs our best ever showing for the upcoming awards event. During the quarter, we also expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets including Japan, Canada, Italy, and Germany, enabling more businesses to use the power of iPhone to accept contactless payments. And we announced new updates to our services coming this fall, including US national park hikes and custom walk routes and Apple Maps, the ability to pay with rewards using Apple Pay, collaborative listening with Apple Music, and a redesigned Apple Fitness+ experience to help users make the most of our library of workouts and meditations. Turning to retail, we continue to expand in emerging markets with our first ever location in Malaysia. Customers from all over the country came together with our team members to celebrate this special moment. Elsewhere in the world, our teams have been sharing the magic of Apple Vision Pro and demos that delight, inspire, and deeply move customers exploring the wonders of spatial computing for the first time. At the heart of all of our innovations are the values that guide everything we do. We believe fundamentally that the best technology is technology that works for everyone. And in honor of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we introduced all new capabilities to give users more ways to take advantage of all our products can do. These include eye tracking for users to control iPhone or iPad visually, music haptics to give those who are deaf or hard of hearing a tangible way to experience music, and vocal shortcuts that tie task to a user's voice. And we are committed as ever to shipping products that offer the highest standards of privacy for our users. With everything we do, whether it's offering a browser like Safari that prevents third-parties from tracking you across the internet or providing new features like the ability to lock and hide apps, we are determined to keep our users in control of their own data. And we are just as dedicated to ensuring the security of our users' data. That's why we work to minimize the amount of data we collect and work to maximize how much is processed directly on people's devices, a foundational principle that is at the core of all we build, including Apple Intelligence. And we continue to make significant progress on the environment. We are proud to say that all of our data centers, including those that will run private cloud compute, operate on 100% renewable energy. At Apple, we're constantly accelerating our pace of innovation. We are a company in relentless pursuit of big ideas. Time and again, we've seen how a spark of creativity can reach breakthrough velocity, reach across previously unexplored dimensions, and ultimately take flight in ways that can change the world. It's why we're going to keep investing in the meaningful innovation that enriches the lives of all of our customers. We have a busy time ahead of us, and I couldn't be more excited for all the amazing things yet to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\\nLuca Maestri : Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, despite 230 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact. We achieved growth in the vast majority of our markets, with June quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $61.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to our unmatched levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with an all-time record in developed markets and a June quarter record in emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.3% near the high end of our guidance range and down 30 basis points sequentially driven by a different mix within products which was partially offset by a favorable mix shift towards services and cost savings. Products gross margin was 35.3%, down 130 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 74% down 60 basis points from last quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided and up 7% year-over-year. Net income was $21.4 billion, diluted EPS of $1.40 was up 11% year-over-year and set a June quarter record. And operating cash flow was very strong at $28.9 billion, also a June quarter record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year, but grew on a constant currency basis. We set June quarter records across several countries, including the UK, Spain, Poland, Mexico, Indonesia, and the Philippines. And the iPhone Active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the June quarter, many iPhone models were among the top selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top selling model in the US, urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. Customer satisfaction on the iPhone 15 family continues to be extremely high, with 451 Research measuring it at 98% in the US in their latest reports. Mac generated $7 billion in revenue, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the MacBook Air powered by the M3 chip. We saw particularly strong performance in our emerging markets, with June quarter records for Mac in Latin America, India, and South Asia. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of MacBook Air customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the US. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, up 24% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Customers are loving the latest iPad lineup for its new design and display, unparalleled performance, AI capabilities and much more. The iPad install base has continued to grow and is an all-time high, as half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the US. Wearables, home and accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year, a sequential acceleration from the March quarter. Watch and AirPods continue to face a difficult compare against prior year launches of the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch install base to a new all-time high. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicate a customer satisfaction of 97% for watch in the US. In services, total revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year. We continue to have great momentum in services, as the growth of our installed base of active devices, sets a strong foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. And we see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reach a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Also, paid subscriptions showed strong double digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. And we are constantly focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services. From critically acclaimed new content on Apple TV+ to new games on Apple Arcade and the many latest features we previewed during WWDC for iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Cash, Apple Music, and more. Turning to enterprise, we continue to see businesses, leveraging our entire suite of products to drive productivity and creativity for their teams and customers. USAA, a leading insurance and financial services company, recently expanded beyond their existing iPhone and iPad deployments to provide their employees with the latest MacBook Air. And American Express has continued to add to their fleet of over 10,000 Macs to enhance their employees' productivity, security, and collaboration. We're also excited to see leading organizations such as Boston Children's Hospital and Lufthansa using Apple Vision Pro to build innovative spatial computing experiences to transform the training of their workforces. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $153 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $4.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of $101 billion. As a result, net cash was $52 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $32 billion to shareholders, including $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $26 billion through open market repurchases of 139 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect foreign exchange to continue to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. We expect our September quarter total company revenue to grow year-over-year at a rate similar to the June quarter. We expect services revenue to grow double digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the first three quarters of this fiscal year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.2 billion and $14.4 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli : Thank you Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\\nOperator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\nErik Woodring: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe Tim, if we start with you, you know, I thought some of the color you provided before the call about iPhone 15 performing better than the iPhone 14 was interesting. So just with that context, can you maybe help us understand where you see iPhone replacement cycles today, where you think the size of the base of iPhones that are aged and likely to upgrade are, and what that translates to in potential pent-up demand, as we enter a new iPhone cycle. And I have a follow-up, thank you.\\nTim Cook: Yes, hi Eric. The installed base hit an all-time high during the quarter and so we were very happy about that. iPhone in general grew in constant currency. And the 15, as you point out, if you look at the same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14, the 15 is doing better than the 14. And so that's kind of a state of where we currently are. In terms of upgrade rates, it's very difficult mid-cycle to call upgrade rates. I would just say that with Apple Intelligence, we are very excited about the level of value that we're going to provide to users. And we believe that -- that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade.\\nErik Woodring: Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks, Tim. And then second, can you maybe dig into the China dynamics a bit? Sales down 6% this quarter, 3% in constant currency, an improvement from last quarter on a tougher compare that came on the back of some iPhone discounting. So can you maybe just share color on the China market as a whole how much you believe promotions helped in the quarter, how sustainable this improvement is, and if this performance really changes any of your approach to the China market as we look forward. Thanks so much.\\nTim Cook: Yeah, Erik, as you point out, we decreased by 6.5% year-over-year for the whole of Greater China. And if you look at it on a constant currency basis, we declined by less than 3%. So over 50% of the decline year-over-year is currency related. That is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year, and so we're happy to see the acceleration. If you look at iPhone in particular for Greater China, the installed base set a record. We also in Mainland China set a June quarter record for upgraders and so that's a very strong signal and in fact from Kantar -- the survey from Kantar this quarter showed that iPhones were the top three models in urban China. Also, if you look at -- one of the things we look at is the 15 family compared to the 14 family for the same number of weeks from launch. So this goes all the way back to the September of 2023. If you look at that, the 15 is outperforming the 14. And so those are some of the color I would provide. In addition, one of the things that we're very focused on is the level of new customers buying our products. And so if you look at this on the Mac and iPad, in Mainland China, the majority of customers buying or buying for the first time, buying that product for the first time and the watch, the vast, vast majority of people are buying a product for the first time. And during the quarter, I should say also that iPad returned to growth in Greater China, as it did around the world. And so we continue to be confident in the long-term opportunity in China. I don't know how every chapter of the book reads, but we're very confident in the long-term.\\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much.\\nTim Cook: Yeah.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Erik. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.\\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Hey, Tim, you know, now that you've launched or announced Apple intelligence, do you have any ideas on how it may impact services. Would it – do you feel like it'll accelerate your Services business augmented? And maybe folks will need to buy more storage and some other things. How are you thinking about it as a catalyst for Services into next year? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.\\nTim Cook: We started the rollout of Apple Intelligence this week with developers, so some of the features are out there as of Monday. And we couldn't be more excited about getting them out there. Obviously, this will enable developers to take their apps to the next level. And so we are taking the first step in getting the beta out there, and we can't wait to see what kind of amazing things they do with it.\\nBen Reitzes: Okay. Thanks. And then Luca, with regard to gross margin, it's been -- there's been some component price inflation and mix. Do you mind just giving us a little more color on how you are managing that sequentially and how you feel about the current component environment as an impact on margins? Thanks.\\nLuca Maestri: Sure, Ben. I think I'll give you a bit of the walk for the June quarter and then get into the outlook that we provided for the September quarter. At the total company level, we've reported 46.3%. It is down 30 basis points sequentially, and it was really driven by a different mix. Within products, of course, we launched very important products like the iPad during the course of the quarter. But we had an offset from a shift in mix towards Services, and we got some good cost savings. And so when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, we are up significantly on the margin front. And keep in mind that foreign exchange continues to be a bit of a headwind for us. As we go into the September quarter, we are guiding 45.5% to 46.5%, which is kind of within the guidance that we provided last quarter. Again similar dynamics, we expect a slightly different mix. We expect foreign exchange to have a minimal impact sequentially, although a more significant impact on a year-over-year basis. On the commodity side, I think that is what you are referring to, yes we have seen some increases on the memory front, but the rest of the commodities, we see a continuous decline. So in general, we feel -- we're well positioned. And as you know well, these are very high levels of gross margin for us and we are pleased where we are.\\nBen Reitzes: Okay. Thanks a lot.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Ben. Operator may we have the next question please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\\nMike Ng: Hi, good afternoon. I just have two questions. First, I was wondering if you could talk about whether or not you've seen a shift in demand for iPhone 15 Pro, Pro Max models since WWDC that could potentially foreshadow consumer demand for Apple Intelligence enabled phones?\\nTim Cook: We just announced the sort of the requirements at the system and the silicon level in June. And so we had very limited time during the quarter. So it's really too early to tell.\\nMike Ng: That's fair. And then with the focus on upgrader potential over the next several years, I was just wondering if you could talk about what you are expecting from the US promotional environment from your channel partners, whether that's US wireless carriers, given the importance of device sales for those partners during an upgrade cycle. Or any retail support on what could be a very strong smartphone upgrade period? Thank you.\\nTim Cook: We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and what it brings, and it is another compelling reason for an upgrade. I'd leave the promotional question for the sort of the carriers themselves to answer. But I believe it will be a very key time for -- and a compelling upgrade cycle.\\nMike Ng: Great. Thank you Tim.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Mike. Operator, can we have the next question please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon everyone. And I have two as well. I guess, Tim, maybe back to the Apple Intelligence dynamic. There's clearly a lot of excitement from consumers around what Apple Intelligence could mean for them. Can you just touch on your -- do you think the intent is to launch all the Apple Intelligence features at the same time to consumers, or do you think they end up getting staggered a bit? And if they are staggered, do you think it impacts how consumers come out and buy the next-generation iPhone?\\nTim Cook: The rollout, as we mentioned in June, sort of -- we've actually started with developers this week. We started with some features of Apple Intelligence, not the complete suite. There are other features like languages beyond US English that will happen over the course of the year, and there are other features that will happen over the course of the year. And ChatGPT is integrated by the end of the calendar year. And so yes, so it’s a staggered launch.\\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then I guess your Services growth rates have been extremely impressive for several quarters and it seems like it is accelerated recently. Can you just touch -- talk about when you look at this double-digit growth, how much of that do you think is coming from the installed base growth versus better ARPU or better monetization of the installed base? And how do you kind of see that mix changing as you go forward?\\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Amit, it is Luca. It's a combination of a number of factors. The installed base growth is very important of course, because we have a larger pool of customers that uses the ecosystem and uses our Services. We are seeing and we've seen this consistently for many, many quarters now. We see continued growth in the level of engagement that our customers have with our ecosystem. We have more transacting accounts every quarter, so more people using the ecosystem both the free elements of the ecosystem and the paid elements. We see paid accounts growing double digits, and we've seen that for many, many quarters. Now we look at our paid subscriptions on our platform, and they are growing strong double digits as well. So obviously, the growing level of engagement helps us both from an ARPU standpoint and just a volume standpoint. Obviously, as you've seen over the last several years, we launched new services over time, and we've launched many new services, fairly recently. Obviously, our payments business is relatively new, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Fitness+, so many other services we've added. And so we are providing more and more opportunities for our customers to interact with the ecosystem. And we believe we are doing also a very good job at improving the quality of these services and improving the amount of content that we make available. We continue to make significant investments on TV+, on Apple Arcade. We are launching new shows, new games all the time. And I think you will continue to see that as we go forward. We are very, very happy with the 14% growth that we had this quarter because, particularly if you look at the performance that we had in Services a year ago, the compares for us tend to get a bit more challenging in the second half of our fiscal year. But in spite of that, we delivered a level of growth that was better than what we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Amit. Operator we will take the next question please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. Tim, you announced Apple Intelligence, but you also announced partnerships with OpenAI and presumably more coming down the road. How should investors think about the monetization models around these partnerships where the CapEx investments are clearly being made by these potential partners. But you're obviously -- they're leveraging your distribution to your very attractive installed base. So in the long-term, do you see the Apple Intelligence part -- the Services growth from Apple Intelligence being the larger contributor over time? Or do you see these partnerships becoming a larger contributor over time? And I have a follow-up.\\nTim Cook: I think the way that I look at it is that Apple Intelligence is the on-device processing and the Private Cloud Compute. And a lot of that will be things with a personal context. And then for world knowledge, we are integrating with ChatGPT initially, and that will be focused on world knowledge as I said. And so the monetization model, I don't want to get into the terms of the commercial agreements because they are confidential between the parties. But I see both aspects as being very important. People want both.\\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks. As a follow-up maybe for Luca. Just stepping back to the gross margin discussion again. If I look at calendar 2023, you had on average 150 basis points increase in product gross margins on a year-on-year basis. In 2024 so far, it had been more flat year-on-year. When we think about that, is the incremental headwind, I mean there was FX headwinds throughout the last several years. So ex-FX, are there other incremental headwinds that are either temporary or structural in nature that are perhaps limiting further upside to what are obviously very strong gross margins? Thank you.\\nLuca Maestri: Yes. Of course, as you said, the foreign exchange continues to be -- this is incremental on a year-over-year basis. And it is one of those things that is outside of our control. We try to hedge our exposures. But it is what it is. We know that when the dollar is strong, our gross margins are affected. The other element that I think it's always important to keep in mind is that within the Products business, our products have different margin profiles. And depending on the relative success in the marketplace, our products' gross margin tends to move. And so the mix of our products has an impact on gross margins, right? And so we need to pay attention to that. Of course, we just launched an iPad and that is one of the factors. But we want all our products to be very successful in the marketplace. And that's why we always look at gross margin dollars as the first order of priority, and gross margin percentage tends to follow from that. The other factor that obviously has an impact, a significant impact is the state of the commodity markets, and they tend to go in cycles. And so we will see how that plays out over time. But in general, we feel good about the level of gross margins that we have for our products business, and we think we are in a good position there.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Wamsi. Operator, can we have the next question please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nKrish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the strong results. The first one for Luca or Tim. We keep hearing about these increasing silicon content for AI edge devices. And also, I think, Luca you spoke about increasing commodity costs. So I'm curious how to think about margins for these new AI devices. And Tim, do any of these Apple Intelligence features need more hardware updates than what we have today? And then I have a quick follow-up.\\nTim Cook: Maybe I'll take the second one first and then pass it over to Luca. In terms of the requirements to run Apple Intelligence, there are system requirements and there are silicon requirements. And so from an iPhone point of view, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will run Apple Intelligence and the successor products obviously. If you look at the Mac, it starts with the M series of silicon that started in 2020. And the iPad is the same, and so it starts with the M series of silicon. And so there are system requirements and silicon requirements that go with each of those.\\nLuca Maestri: And from a gross margin standpoint, as you know, we don't provide any color past the current quarter, and we just provided guidance for the quarter 45.5% to 46.5%. It is essentially broadly in line with what we reported for the June quarter. So we'll take it quarter by quarter and we will report as the time goes by.\\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up for Tim. Thanks for the color on China. We also see many other consumer discretionary and luxury brands talk about a weak China. And I think Tim, you said half the details was FX related. I'm curious, the other half of the weakness, was that more China macro related or do you think it is kind of like specific to Apple with domestic competitors? Any other color you could give would be very helpful. Thank you very much.\\nTim Cook: Well, certainly, the competitive environment there is the most competitive in the world. I've said that before and that remains to be the case. The macroeconomic factors have been in the press too, and I'm not an expert on those. I can only tell you what we're seeing. And we were pleased that the business showed improvement from the first half of the year.\\nKrish Sankar: Thanks Tim.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Krish. Operator, can we have the next question please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\\nDavid Vogt: Great. Two, if I may also. Tim, first one for you. I know it is early days, and you talked about the developers just getting their hands on Apple Intelligence. But when you think about the categories that are currently in the App Store and kind of what you think app developers could do with this new technology, what's your instinct say in terms of -- are these going to be iterative applications to currently available applications? Is there any sort of category that you think lends itself more naturally to Apple Intelligence? Is it games? Is it more creative? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about it. And then I have a follow-up for Luca. Thanks.\\nTim Cook: If you look at how we've deployed Apple Intelligence or are deploying Apple Intelligence, we've really thought about it at pretty much all of the apps that you use every day. And so we've thought about it from Notes to Mail to Messages and all the rest. And so there is been a deep level of thinking about how it affects those apps. And that's going to surface Apple Intelligence in a way that is natural to the user, in a way that will I think, get them very excited about it and get usage. Similarly, I think the developers will do that on a broad basis with their apps as well. And so I think, it is profound and we'll see what the developers do. But we're very excited to get the initial seed out there this week and see what they do. I think it will be amazing, yes.\\nDavid Vogt: Yes. No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. And Luca, just maybe -- I know you didn't give a full rundown of product categories in your prepared remarks. But if I kind of take your comments at face value, I guess what I'm trying to think about is for the next quarter, it sounds like with Services being relatively strong and FX easing a little bit. You are effectively saying that product revenue in the September quarter is going to basically be flat with the September quarter last year ahead of a product launch. And so I'm just trying to get a sense for, what are the puts and takes in that sort of outlook particularly as you have Apple Intelligence hopefully stoking the fire for demand going forward? Thanks.\\nLuca Maestri: Well, we have provided -- let me repeat what we provided. We think that we are going to be growing total company revenue at a rate that is similar to what we reported, so the plus 5%, right? In spite of the fact that we are going to have some foreign exchange headwinds, and we said about 150 basis points in the December quarter. And we said that we will grow Services double digits at a rate that is similar to what we've reported for the first three quarters of the fiscal year. We are not going into the other categories. I think there is a lot of good math that you can do from what we've given you here. Keep in mind on the Mac that we will have a challenging compare from a year ago, given the fact that we launched and we had the full quarter impact of the launch of the MacBook Air 15-inch a year ago. And also on the iPad, we reported 24% growth in the June quarter. Clearly we had the benefit from the launch in the June quarter of the new products, the iPad Air and the iPad Pro. So important to keep that in mind on a sequential basis.\\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you very much.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you David. Operator may we have the next question please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\\nAtif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. The first one is for Tim. I know it's early days. The feedback on Apple Intelligence software features like notification summary and reduced interruption focus from the developers who have tried the iOS 18.1 beta version this week is very positive. My question is in response to an earlier question, you talked about a staggered launch on some of these software features. So are you expecting most of the features that you announced at WWDC to be part of iOS 18? Or we should be thinking that some of these features could potentially be part of iOS 19 next year?\\nTim Cook: Our objective that we said in June is to roll out US English starting in the fall and that is to users, and then proceed with more functionality, more features, if you will, and more languages and regions coverage as we proceed across the next year. And so we sort of gave a time frame that -- and we're tracking to that.\\nAtif Malik: Understand. And the next one for Luca. Luca the Services growth momentum seems very strong. Are you seeing any impact from changes made to comply with the DMA rules?\\nLuca Maestri: Well, as you know we have introduced some changes to the way we run the App Store in Europe already in March. And we are seeing a good level of adoption from developers on those changes. We are on an ongoing basis, discussing with the European Commission how to ensure full compliance with the DMA. It is obviously early stage, but in general, our results for the Services business and for the App Store have been pretty good until now. Again to just provide you a frame of reference, the percentage of revenue that we generate from the European Union on the App Store is about 7% of the total.\\nAtif Malik: Very helpful. Thank you.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli : Thank you Atif. Operator may we have the next question please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Tim, if I can just ask you about Apple Intelligence as well. There is a regulatory aspect as well in certain geographies. You mentioned the staggered launch that you are aiming for and the timelines you're thinking. How are you thinking about the complexity of the regulatory process, in particular like EU and maybe China? And does -- in terms of your timelines of the rollout, are you sort of embedding in the regulatory aspect here? And how should we think about timing then including that? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\\nTim Cook: We are engaged as you would guess, with both regulatory bodies that you mentioned. And our objective is to move as fast as we can, obviously because our objective is always to get features out there for everyone. We have to understand the regulatory requirements before we can commit to doing that and commit a schedule to doing that. But we're very constructively engaged with both.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay, got it. And a quick one on the Wearables category, Luca. I know you mentioned the acceleration there on a sequential basis. Maybe you can just sort of parse that out in terms of what -- which categories drove the acceleration because that's been a category that has been lagging a bit in terms of revenue trends for the past couple of quarters. So just curious what is starting to sort of drive it to accelerate on a sequential basis? Thank you.\\nTim Cook: Yes, I'll take that one. I think the important thing to remember when you look at the Wearables, Home and Accessories categories is that we have a difficult launch compare. And we've been running that for a few quarters and we still have that because last year had the continued benefit from the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the very first Watch Ultra. And so it is important to keep that in mind. If you sort of take a step back, however and look at the business across the trailing 12 months, it is grown -- the Wearables, Home and Accessories business has grown to almost $40 billion, which is double what it was five years ago.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Samik. Operator, may we have the last question please.\\nOperator: Our last question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\\nRichard Kramer: Thanks. Thanks very much. Tim, you referenced the investment in innovation, and your R&D sales ratio reached what I think was a June quarter record even before launching Apple Intelligence. Do you see the rollout of these features requiring further increases in R&D or increases in OpEx or CapEx for cloud compute capacity? And is it even possible to forecast the Services usage as they roll out, given that they are so new for consumers? Thanks.\\nTim Cook: Clearly, we have increased R&D over time. We have been investing in AI and ML for years. And in addition to investing more, we've also redeployed certain skills onto AI and ML. And so the growth in sort of embedded in our numbers that we've shared here, it is increasing year-over-year. On the CapEx part, it is important to remember that we employ a hybrid kind of approach, where we do things internally and we have certain partners that we do business with externally where the CapEx would appear in their respective businesses. But yes, I mean you can expect that there is -- we will continue to invest and increase it year-on-year.\\nRichard Kramer: Okay. And maybe a quick follow-up for Luca. When we look at the free cash flow margins for the first nine months, they are up materially. And given this year's product mix, can you describe to us what exactly in the Services mix or cost control is driving what seems to be structurally higher free cash flow margins across the business?\\nLuca Maestri: Yes, I'm glad you noticed that. We are pretty pleased with that fact. And I think you probably also noticed that we've increased our return of capital to shareholders this quarter. This one was a record quarter for us. Well, it's a combination of a number of things. Of course, an improvement in the top-line helps the margin expansion that we've had over the last several years and several quarters obviously has helped. And so that is driving better operating cash flow. On the CapEx front as Tim said, we employ a hybrid model. Some of the investments show up on our balance sheet and some other investments show up somewhere else and we pay, as we go. But in general, we try to run the company efficiently. We continue to think that capital efficiency is a good thing. And therefore, we are pleased with the fact that our free cash flow is doing well this year.\\nRichard Kramer: Okay. Thanks.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone.

       " \"Suhasini Chandramouli: Good Afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q2 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\\nTim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $90.8 billion and an EPS record of $1.53 for the March quarter. We set revenue records in more than a dozen countries and regions. These include, among others, March quarter records in Latin-America and the Middle East, as well as Canada, India, Spain and Turkey. We also achieved an all-time revenue record in Indonesia, one of the many markets where we continue to see so much potential. In services, we set an all-time revenue record, up 14% over the past year. Keep in mind, as we described on the last call, in the March quarter a year-ago, we were able to replenish iPhone channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the December quarter COVID-related supply disruptions on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. We estimate this one-time impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter revenue last year. If we remove this from last year's results, our March quarter total company revenue this year would have grown. Despite this impact, we were still able to deliver the records I described. Of course, this past quarter, we were thrilled to launch Apple Vision Pro and it has been so wonderful to hear from people who now get to experience the magic of spatial computing. They describe the impossible becoming possible right before their eyes and they share their amazement and their emotions about what they can do now, whether it's reliving their most treasured memories or having a movie theater experience right in their living room. It's also great to see the enthusiasm from the enterprise market. For example, more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought Apple Vision Pro units and are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren't possible before, and this is just the beginning. Looking ahead, we're getting ready for an exciting product announcement next week that we think our customers will love. And next month, we have our Worldwide Developers Conference, which has generated enormous enthusiasm from our developers. We can't wait to reveal what we have in-store. We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in Generative AI. We are making significant investments, and we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon. We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple's silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on privacy, which underpins everything we create. As we push innovation forward, we continue to manage thoughtfully and deliberately through an uneven macroeconomic environment and remain focused on putting our users at the center of everything we do. Now let's turn to our results for the March quarter across each product category, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue for the March quarter was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year. We faced a difficult compare over the previous year due to the $5 billion impact that I mentioned earlier. However, we still saw growth on iPhone in some markets, including Mainland China, and according to Kantar during the quarter, the two best-selling smartphones in Urban China were the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max. I was in China recently where I had the chance to meet with developers and creators who are doing remarkable things with iPhone. And just a couple of weeks ago, I visited Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore, where it was incredible to see all the ways customers and communities are using our products and services to do amazing things. Everywhere I travel, people have such a great affinity for Apple, and it's one of the many reasons I'm so optimistic about the future. Turning to Mac. March quarter revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% from a year ago. We had an amazing launch in early March with the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air. The world's most popular laptop is the best consumer laptop for AI with breakthrough performance of the M3 chip and it’s even more powerful neural engine. Whether it's an entrepreneur starting a new business or a college student finishing their degree, users depend on the power and portability of MacBook Air to take them places they couldn't have gone without it. In iPad, revenue for the March quarter was $5.6 billion, 17% lower year-over-year, due to a difficult compare with the momentum following the launch of M2 iPad Pro and the 10th Generation iPad last fiscal year. iPad continues to stand apart for its versatility, power and performance. For video editors, music makers and creatives of all kinds, iPad is empowering users to do more than they ever could with a tablet. Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, March quarter revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% from a year-ago due to a difficult launch compare on Watch and AirPods. Apple Watch is helping runners go the extra mile on their wellness journeys, keeping hikers on course with the latest navigation capabilities in watchOS 10, and enabling users of all fitness levels to live a healthier day. Across our watch lineup, we're harnessing AI and machine-learning to power lifesaving features like a regular rhythm notifications and fall detection. I often hear about how much these features mean to users and their loved ones and I'm thankful that so many people are able to get help in their time of greatest need. As I shared earlier, we set an all-time revenue record in services with $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We also achieved all-time revenue records across several categories and geographic segments. Audiences are tuning in on screens large, small and spatial and are enjoying Apple TV+ Originals like Palm Royale and Sugar. And we have some incredible theatrical releases coming this year, including Wolves, which reunites George Clooney and Brad Pitt. Apple TV+ productions continue to be celebrated as major awards contenders. Since launch, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,100 award nominations and 480 wins. Meanwhile, we're enhancing the live sports experience with a new iPhone app, Apple Sports. This free app allows fans to follow their favorite teams and leagues with real-time scores, stats and more. Apple Sports is the perfect companion for MLS Season Pass subscribers. Turning to retail, our stores continued to be vital spaces for connection and innovation. I was delighted to be in Shanghai for the opening of our latest flagship store. The energy and enthusiasm from our customers was truly something to behold. And across the United States, our incredible retail teams have been sharing Vision Pro demos with customers, delighting them with a profound and emotional experience of using it for the very first time. Everywhere we operate and everything we do, we're guided by our mission to enrich users' lives and lead the world better than we found it, whether we're making Apple podcasts more accessible with a new transcripts feature or helping to safeguard iMessage users' privacy with new protections that can defend against advances in quantum computing. Our environmental work is another great example of how innovation and our values come together. As we work toward our goal of being carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030, we are proud of how we've been able to innovate and do more for our customers while taking less from the planet. Since 2015, Apple has cut our overall emissions by more than half, while revenue grew nearly 65% during that same time period. And we're now using more recycled materials in our products than ever before. Earlier this spring, we launched our first-ever product to use 50% recycled materials with a new M3-powered MacBook Air. We're also investing in new solar and wind power in the U.S. and Europe, both to power our growing operations and our users' devices. And we're working with partners in India and the U.S. to replenish 100% of the water we use in places that need it most with the goal of delivering billions of gallons of water benefits over the next two decades. Through our Restore Fund, Apple has committed $200 million to nature-based carbon removal projects. And last month, we welcomed two supplier partners as new investors, who will together invest up to an additional $80 million in the fund. Whether we're enriching lives of users across the globe or doing our part to be a force for good in the world, we do everything with a deep sense of purpose at Apple. And I'm proud of the impact we've already made at the halfway point in a year of unprecedented innovation. I couldn't be more excited for the future we have ahead of us, driven by the imagination and innovation of our teams and the enduring importance of our products and services in people's lives. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $90.8 billion, down 4% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative year-over-year impact of 140 basis points on our results. Products revenue was $66.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to the challenging compare on iPhone that Tim described earlier, which was partially offset by strength from Mac. And thanks to our unparalleled customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers who are new to our products, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments. Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year with record performance in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.6%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings and favorable mix to services, partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 36.6%, down 280 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 74.6%, up 180 basis points from last quarter due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.4 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 5% year-over-year. Net income was $23.6 billion, diluted EPS was $1.53 and a March quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at $22.7 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year, due to the almost $5 billion impact from a year ago that Tim described earlier. Adjusting for this one-time impact, iPhone revenue would be roughly flat to last year. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. And during the March quarter, we saw many iPhone models as the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, an iPhone was the top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, Australia, the U.K., France, Germany and Japan. And the iPhone 15 family continues to be very popular with customers. 451 Research recently measured customer satisfaction at 99% in the U.S. Mac revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our new MacBook Air, powered by the M3 chip. Customers are loving the incredible AI performance of the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. And our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of our MacBook Air buyers during the quarter being new to Mac. Also customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the U.S. iPad generated $5.6 billion in revenue, down 17% year-over-year. iPad continued to face a challenging compare against the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and iPad 10th Generation from last year. At the same time, the iPad installed base has continued to grow and is at an all-time high as over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. In addition, the latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for iPad in the US. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to a difficult launch compare. Last year, we had the continued benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro second-generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch installed base to a new all-time high and customer satisfaction was recently measured at 95% in the U.S. In services, as I mentioned, total revenue reached an all-time record of $23.9 billion, growing 14% year-over-year with our installed-base of active devices continuing to grow at a nice pace. This provides a strong foundation for the future growth of the services business as we continued to see increased customer engagement with our ecosystem. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. And paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over $1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. We continued to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from creating new games on Arcade and great new shows on TV+ to launching additional countries and partners for Apple Pay. Turning to enterprise, our customers continued to invest in Apple products to drive productivity and innovation. We see more and more enterprise customers embracing the Mac. In Healthcare, Epic Systems, the world's largest electronic medical record provider, recently launched its native app for the Mac, making it easier for healthcare organizations like Emory Health to transition thousands of PCs to the Mac for clinical use. And since the launch of Vision Pro last quarter, many leading enterprise customers have been investing in this amazing new product to bring spatial computing apps and experiences to life. We are seeing so many compelling use cases from aircraft engine maintenance training at KLM Airlines to real-time team collaboration for racing at Porsche to immersive kitchen design at Lowe's. We couldn't be more excited about the spatial computing opportunity in enterprise. Taking a quick step back, when we look at our performance during the first-half of our fiscal year, total company revenue was roughly flat to the prior year in spite of having one less week of sales during the period and some foreign exchange headwinds. We were particularly pleased with our strong momentum in emerging markets, as we set first-half revenue records in several countries and regions, including Latin-America, the Middle East, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Turkey. These results, coupled with double-digit growth in services and strong levels of gross margin, drove a first half diluted EPS record of $3.71, up 9% from last year. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $162 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3.2 billion in maturing debt and commercial paper was unchanged sequentially, leaving us with total debt of $105 billion. As a result, net cash was $58 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.5 billion through open-market repurchases of $130 million Apple's shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, our Board has authorized today an additional $110 billion for share repurchases, as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash-neutral over time. We are also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.25 per share of common stock, and we continued to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward as we've done for the last 12 years. This cash dividend will be payable on May 16, 2024 to shareholders of record as of May 13, 2024. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect our June quarter total company revenue to grow low-single-digits year-over-year in spite of a foreign exchange headwind of about 2.5 percentage points. We expect our services business to grow double-digits at a rate similar to the growth we reported for the first-half of the fiscal year. And we expect iPad revenue to grow double-digits. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% to -- and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. With that, let's open the call to questions.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\\nOperator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\\nMike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I have two, first, I'll ask about the June quarter guidance. The revenue outlook for low-single digits growth, I was wondering if you could run through some of the product assumptions, iPhone, like what kind of gives you confidence around that? And then on the service momentum, what was better than expected in the quarter? And then I just have a quick follow-up.\\nLuca Maestri: Hey, Mike. It's Luca. On the outlook, what we said is we expect to grow low-single-digits in total for the company. We expect services to grow double-digits at a rate that is similar to what we've done in the first-half of our fiscal year. And we've also mentioned that iPad should grow double-digits. This is the color that we're providing for the June quarter. In services, we've seen a very strong performance across the board. We've mentioned, we've had records in several categories, in several geographic segments. It's very broad based, our subscription business is going well. Transacting accounts and paid accounts are growing double-digits. And also we've seen a really strong performance both in developed and emerging markets. So very pleased with the way the services business is going.\\nMike Ng: Great. Thank you. And I wanted to ask about, as Apple leans more into AI and Generative AI, should we expect any changes to the historical CapEx cadence that we've seen in the last few years of about $10 billion to $11 billion per year or any changes to, you know, how we may have historically thought about the split between tooling, data center and facilities? Thank you very much.\\nLuca Maestri: Yes. We are obviously very excited about the opportunity with Gen AI. We obviously are pushing very hard on innovation on every front and we've been doing that for many, many years. Just during the last five years, we spent more than a $100 billion in research and development. As you know, on the CapEx front, we have a bit of a hybrid model where we make some of the investments ourselves. In other cases, we share them with our suppliers and partners on the manufacturing side, we purchased some of the tools and manufacturing equipment. In some of the cases, our suppliers make the investment. On the -- and we do something similar on the data center side. We have our own data center capacity and then we use capacity from third parties. It's a model that has worked well for us historically and we plan to continue along the same lines going forward.\\nMike Ng: Excellent. Thank you very much.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Awesome. Thank you, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Tim, can you talk about the implications to Apple from the changes driven by EU DMA? You've had to open up third-party app stores, clearly disposes some security risks on the one-hand, which can dilute the experience, but also lower payments from developers to Apple. What are you seeing developers choose in these early days and consumers choose in terms of these third-party app stores? And I have a follow-up.\\nTim Cook: It's really too early to answer the question. We just implemented in March, as you probably know, in the European Union, the alternate app stores and alternate billing, et cetera. So we're focused on complying while mitigating the impacts to user privacy and security that you mentioned. And so that's our focus.\\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you, Tim. And Luca, I was wondering if you could comment a bit on the product gross margins, the sequential step down. You noted both mix and leverage. Any more color on the mix, if you could share if customers are at all starting to mix down across product lines or is this more a mix across product lines? Just trying to get some color on customer behavior given some of the broader inflationary pressures. Thank you so much.\\nLuca Maestri: On a sequential basis, yes, we were down. It's primarily the fact that we had a slightly different mix of products than the previous one. Obviously, leverage plays a big role as we move from the holiday quarter into the -- into, you know, a more typical quarter. So I would say primarily leverage in a different mix of products. I mean, we haven't seen anything different in terms within the product categories, we haven't seen anything particular.\\nWamsi Mohan: Thank you so much.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Wamsi. We'll take the next question, please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe my first one, Tim, you've obviously mentioned your excitement around Generative AI multiple times. I'm just curious how Apple is thinking about the different ways in which you can monetize this technology because historically software upgrades haven't been a big factor in driving product cycles. And so could AI be potentially different? And how could that impact replacement cycles? Is there any services angle you'd be thinking? Any early color that you can share on that? And then I have a follow up, please. Thanks.\\nTim Cook: I don't want to get in front of our announcements, obviously. I would just say that we see Generative AI as a very key opportunity across our products. And we believe that we have advantages that set us apart there. And we'll be talking more about it in as we go through the weeks ahead.\\nErik Woodring: Okay. Very fair. Thank you. And then Luca, maybe to just follow up on Wamsi's comments or question. There's a broad concern about the headwind that rising commodity costs have on your product gross margins. Wondering if you could just clarify for us if we take a step back and look at all of the components and commodities that go into your products kind of collectively, are we -- are you seeing these costs rising? Are they falling? What tools do you have to try to help and mitigate some rising costs if at all, rising input costs if at all? Thank you so much.\\nLuca Maestri: Yes. I mean during the last quarter, commodity costs, and in general, component costs have behaved favorably to us. On the memory front, prices are starting to go up. They've gone up slightly during the March quarter. But in general, I think it's been a period not only this quarter, but the last several quarters where, you know, commodities have behaved well for us. Commodities going cycles and so there's obviously always that possibility. Keep in mind that we are starting from a very high level of gross margins. We reported 46.6%, which is something that we haven't seen in our company in decades. And so we're starting from a good point. As you know, we try to buy ahead when the cycles are favorable to us. And so we will try to mitigate if there are headwinds. But in general, we feel particularly for this cycle, we are in good shape.\\nErik Woodring: Thank you so much.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Great. Thank you, Erik. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.\\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks for the question. And hey, Tim, I was wondering if I could ask the China question again. Is there any more color from your visit there that gives you confidence that you've reached a bottom there and that it's turning? And I know you've been -- you've continued to be confident there in the long-term. Just wondering if there was any color as to when you think that the tide turns there? Thanks a lot. And I have a follow-up.\\nTim Cook: Yes, Ben, if you look at our results in Q2 for Greater China, we were down 8%. That's an acceleration from the previous quarter in Q1. And the primary driver of the acceleration was iPhone. And if you then look at iPhone within Mainland China, we grew on a reported basis. That's before any kind of normalization for the supply disruption that we mentioned earlier. And if you look at the top-selling smartphones, the Top 2 in Urban China are iPhones. And while I was there, it was a great visit and we opened a new store in Shanghai and the reception was very warm and highly energetic, and so I left there having a fantastic trip and enjoyed being there. And so I maintain a great view of China in the long-term. I don't know how each and every quarter goes and each and every week. But over the long haul, I have a very positive viewpoint.\\nBen Reitzes: Okay. Hey, thanks, Tim. And then my follow-up, I want to ask this carefully though. It's a -- there's a fear out there that, you may lose some traffic acquisition revenue. And I was wondering if you thought AI from big picture and it doesn't have to be on a long-term basis, I mean from a big picture, if AI is an opportunity for you to continue to monetize your mobile real estate, just how you -- how maybe investors can think about that from a big picture, just given that's been one of the concerns that's potentially been an overhang, of course, due to, you know, a lot of the news and the media around some of the legal cases? And I was wondering if there's just a big-picture color you could give that makes us kind of think about it better and your ability to sort of continue to monetize that real estate? Thanks a lot.\\nTim Cook: I think AI, Generative AI and AI, both are big opportunities for us across our products. And we'll talk more about it in the coming weeks. I think there are numerous ways there that are great for us. And we think that we're well-positioned.\\nBen Reitzes: Thanks, Tim.\\nTim Cook: Yes.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nKrish Sankar: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Again, sorry to beat the AI haul. But Tim, I know you don't want to like reveal a lot. But I'm just kind of curious, because last quarter you spoke about how you're getting traction in enterprise. Is the AI strategy going to be both consumer and enterprise or is it going to be one after the other? Any color would be helpful? And then, I have a follow-up for Luca.\\nTim Cook: Our focus on enterprise has been and you know through the quarter and the quarters that preceded it on selling iPhones and iPads and Macs and we recently added Vision Pro to that. And we're thrilled with what we see there in terms of interest from big companies buying some to explore ways they can use it. And so I see enormous opportunity in the enterprise. I wouldn't want to cabin that to AI only. I think there's a great opportunity for us around the world in the enterprise.\\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful. And then for Luca, you know, I'm kind of curious on -- given the macro-environment, on the hardware side, are you seeing a bias towards like standard iPhone versus the Pro model? The reason I'm asking the question is that there's a weaker consumer spending environment, yet your services business is still growing and has amazing gross margins. So I'm just trying to like square the circle over there. Thank you.\\nLuca Maestri: I'm not sure I fully understand the question, but in general, what we are seeing on the product side, we continued to see a lot of interest at the top of the range of our products. And I think it's a combination of consumers wanting to purchase the best product that we offer in the different categories and our ability to make those purchases more affordable over time. We've introduced several financing solutions from installment plans to trading programs that reduce the affordability threshold and therefore, customers tend to buy -- want to buy at the top of the range that is very valuable for us in developed markets, but particularly in emerging markets where the affordability issues are more pronounced. But in general, over the last several years and that is also reflected in our gross margins, over the last several years, we've seen this trend, which we think is pretty sustainable.\\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thank you very much, Luca, and thanks, Tim.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. Operator, we'll have the next question, please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. You know, I guess, first off on capital allocation, you folks have about $58 billion of net cash right now. As you think about eventually getting to this net cash-neutral target, do you think at some point, Apple would be open to taking on leverage on the balance sheet and continuing the buyback program? Or is it more like once you get to this neutral position, it's going to be about returning free cash flow back to shareholders? I'm just wondering, how do you think about leverage on your balance sheet over time and what sort of leverage do you think you'd be comfortable taking on?\\nLuca Maestri: Hey, Amit. This is Luca. I would say one step at a time, we have put out this target of getting to net cash-neutral several years ago and we're working very hard to get there. Our free cash flow generation has been very strong over the years, particularly in the last few years. And so as you've seen this year, we've increased the amount that we're allocating to the buyback. For the last couple of years, we were doing $90 billion, now we're doing $110 billion. So let's get there first. It's going to take a while still. And then when we are there, we're going to reassess and see what is the optimal capital structure for the company at that point in time. Obviously, there's going to be a number of considerations that we will need to look at when we get there.\\nAmit Daryanani: Fair enough. I figure it's worth trying anyway. If I go back to this China discussion a bit and, you know, Tim, I think your comments around growth in iPhones in Mainland China is really notable. Could you step back, I mean, these numbers are still declining at least Greater China on a year-over-year basis in aggregate. Maybe just talk about what are you seeing from a macro basis in China and then at least annual decline -- or year-over-year declines that we're seeing. Do you think it's more macro driven or more competitive driven over there? That would be helpful.\\nTim Cook: Yes, I can only tell you what we're seeing. And so I don't want to present myself as a economist. So I'll steer clear of that. From what we saw was an acceleration from Q1, and it was driven by iPhone and iPhone in Mainland China before we adjust for this $5 billion impact that we talked about earlier did grow. That means the other products didn't fare as well. And so we clearly have work there to do. I think it has been and is through last quarter, the most competitive market in the world. And I -- so I, you know, wouldn't say anything other than that. I've said that before, and I believe that it was last quarter as well. And -- but if you step back from the 90-day cycle, what I see is a lot of people moving into the middle class, a -- we try to serve customers very well there and have a lot of happy customers and you can kind of see that in the latest store opening over there. And so I continue to feel very optimistic.\\nAmit Daryanani: Great. Thank you.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. I'm going to roll the two together, so you guys have them both. So Luca obviously, I'm trying to parse through the outlook for the June quarter. And just based on the quick math, it looks like all things being equal, given what you said, the iPhone business is going to be down mid-single-digits again in the June quarter. And if that's the case and maybe this is for Tim obviously, how are you thinking about the competitive landscape in the context of what you just said maybe outside of China and what changes sort of, the consumer demand or receptivity to new devices because we've been in this malaise for a while. Is it really this AI initiative that a lot of companies are pursuing? And do you think that changes sort of the demand drivers going forward? Or is it just really more of a timing issue in terms of the replacement cycle is a little bit long in the tooth, and we see a bit of an upgrade cycle at some point, maybe later this year into next year? Thanks.\\nTim Cook: I do see a key opportunity, as I've mentioned before with Generative AI with all of our devices or the vast majority of our devices. And so I think that if you look out that that's not within the next quarter or so and we don't guide at the product level, but I'm extremely optimistic. And so that -- that's kind of how I view it. In terms of the -- I'll let Luca comment on the outlook portion of it. I think if you step back on iPhone though and you make this adjustment from the previous year, our Q2 results would be flattish on iPhone. And so that's how we performed in Q2.\\nLuca Maestri: Yes, David, on the outlook, I'll only repeat what we said before, and this is the color that we're providing for the quarter. We do expect to grow in total, low-single-digits. And we do expect services to grow double-digits, and we expect iPad to grow double-digits for the rest. I'll let you make assumptions and then we will report three months from now.\\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks guys. I'll get back in the queue.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, David. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question, and I have a couple as well. Maybe for the first one, your services growth accelerated from 11% growth to 14%. If you can sort of dig into the drivers of where or which parts of services did you really see that acceleration? And why it isn't a bit more sustainable as we think about the next quarter? Because I believe you're guiding more to sort of averaging out the first half of the year for the next quarter. So just curious what were the drivers and why not have it a bit more sustainably sort of improve as we go through the remainder of the year? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\\nLuca Maestri: So a number of things on services. First of all, the overall performance was very strong. As I said earlier, all-time records in both developed and emerging markets. So we see our services do well across the world. Records in many of our services categories. There are some categories that are growing very fast also because they are relatively smaller in the scheme of our services business like cloud, video, payment services. You know, those all set all-time revenue records. And so we feel very good about the progress that we're making in services. As we go forward, I'll just point out that if you look at our growth rates a year ago, they improved during the course of the fiscal year last year. So the comps for the services business become a bit more challenging as we go through the year. But in general, as I mentioned, we still expect to grow double-digits in the June quarter at a rate that is very similar to what we've done in the first half.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. Got it. And for my follow up, if I can ask you more specifically about the India market. Obviously, you continue to make new records in terms of revenue in that market. How much of the momentum you're seeing would you associate with your sort of retail strategy in that market, retail expansion relative to maybe some of the supply change or the sort of manufacturing changes or strategy you've undergone or taken in that market itself. Any thoughts around that would be helpful?\\nTim Cook: Sure. We did grow strong double-digit. And so we were very, very pleased about it. It was a new March quarter revenue record for us. As you know, as I've said before, I see it as an incredibly exciting market and it's a major focus for us. In terms of the operational side or supply chain side, we are producing there, from a pragmatic point of view, you need to produce there to be competitive. And so yes, there the two things are linked from that point of view. But we have both operational things going on and we have go-to-market, and initiatives going on. We just opened a couple of stores as last year, as you know, and we see enormous opportunity there. We're continuing to expand our channels, and also working on the developer ecosystem as well. And we've been very pleased that there is a rapidly-growing base of developers there. And so, we're working all of the entire ecosystem from developer to the market to operations, the whole thing. And I just -- I could not be more excited and enthusiastic about it.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. Thank you. Thanks for that.\\nTim Cook: Yes.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Samik. Operator, we'll have the next question, please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from. Please go ahead.\\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the questions, and I think I have to have two as well like everybody else. I guess, I'm going to go back to the China question. I guess, at a high level, the simple question is, when we look at the data points that have been repeatedly reported throughout the course of this quarter, I'm curious, Tim, you know, what are we missing? Like where do you think people are missing, Apple's iPhone traction within the China market, just at a high level, you know, given the data points that were reported throughout this course of the last quarter?\\nTim Cook: I can't address the data points. I can only address what our results are. And we did accelerate last quarter, and the iPhone grew in Mainland China. So that's what the results were. I can't bridge to numbers we didn't come up with.\\nAaron Rakers: Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, I know you guys haven't talked about this, you know, quantified it in quite some time. But I'm curious how we would characterize the channel inventory dynamics for iPhone?\\nTim Cook: Sure. The -- for the March quarter, we decreased channel inventory during the quarter. We usually decreased channel inventory during the Q2 timeframe. So that's not unusual. And we're very comfortable with the overall channel inventory.\\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\\nTim Cook: Yes.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Aaron. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\\nRichard Kramer: Thanks very much. I'm not going to ask about China, but you regularly call out all the rapid growth in many other emerging markets. So is Apple approaching a point where all of those other emerging markets in aggregate might crossover to become larger than your current $70 billion Greater China segments, and maybe investors could look at that for driving growth for the wider business? And then I have a follow-up for Luca. Thanks.\\nLuca Maestri: I think, Richard, you're asking a really interesting question. We were looking at something similar recently. Obviously, China is by far the largest emerging market that we have. But when we started looking at places like India, like Saudi, like Mexico, Turkey, of course, Brazil and Mexico and Indonesia, the numbers are getting large, and we're very happy because these are markets where our market share is low, the populations are large and growing. And our products are really making a lot of progress with the -- in those markets. The level of excitement for the brand is very high. Tim was in Southeast Asia recently, and the level of excitement is incredibly high. So it is very good for us. And then -- and certainly, the numbers are getting larger all the time. And so the gap as you compare it to the numbers in China is reducing, and hopefully, that trajectory continues for a long time.\\nRichard Kramer: Okay. And then as a follow-up, maybe for either of you, I mean, you're coming up on four years from what was incredibly popular iPhone 12 cycle. And, you know, given you're struggling to reduce your net -- your -- reach your net neutral cash position and your margins are sort of near highs, do you see ways to deploy capital more to spur replacement demand in your installed base either with greater device financing, more investment in marketing, more promotions. I mean, do you feel like you needed to produce those sort of margins or is it a more important to spur growth with replacement? Thanks.\\nTim Cook: I think innovation spurs the upgrade cycle, and as one thing, of course, there's economic factors as well that play in there. And what kind of offerings there are from our carrier partners and so forth. And so there's a number of variables in there. But we work all of those, and you know, we price our products for the value that we're delivering. And so that's how we look at it.\\nLuca Maestri: And if I can add to Tim's comments, Richard, one of the things that when you look over the long arc of time that maybe is not fully understood is that we've gone through a long period of very strong dollar. And what that means given that our company sells more than 60% of our revenue is outside the United States. The demand for our products in those markets is stronger than the results that we report just because of the translation of those local currencies into dollars, right? And so that is something to keep in mind as you look at our results, right? And so we are making all the investments that are needed and Tim has talked about innovation. Obviously, we made a lot of progress with financing solutions, with trading programs and so on, and we will continue to make all those investments.\\nRichard Kramer: Okay. Super. Thanks, guys.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. Operator, can we take our last question, please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\\nAtif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions, and I have two questions as well. First for Tim, for enterprise, specifically, what are some of the top two or three use cases on Vision Pro you're hearing most excitement? And then I have a follow-up for Luca.\\nTim Cook: Yes, the great thing is, I'm hearing about so many of them. I wouldn't say that one has emerged as the top, right now. The most impressive thing is that similar to the way people use a Mac, you use it for everything. People are using it for many different things in enterprise, and that varies from field service to training to healthcare related things like preparing a doctor for pre-op surgery or advanced imaging. And so the -- it commands control centers. And so it's an enormous number of different verticals. And you know our focus is on -- is growing that ecosystem and getting more apps and more and more enterprises engaged. And the event that we had recently, I can't overstate the enthusiasm in the room. It was extraordinary. And so we're off to a good start, I think, with the enterprise.\\nAtif Malik: Great. And then Luca, I believe you mentioned that for the March quarter, the commodity pricing environment was favorable. Can you talk about what you're assuming for commodity pricing on memory and et cetera for the June quarter and maybe for the full-year?\\nLuca Maestri: Yes, we provide guidance just for the current quarter. So I'll tell you about the, you know, the guidance. We're guiding to again to a very high level of gross margins, 45.5% to 46.5%. Within that guidance, we expect memory to be a slight headwind, not a very large one, but a slight headwind. And the same applies for foreign exchange. Foreign exchange will have a negative impact sequentially of about 30 basis points.\\nAtif Malik: Thank you.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Atif.

       " \"Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q1 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Before turning the call over to Tim, I would like to remind everyone that the quarter we're reporting today included 13 weeks, whereas the quarter we reported a year ago included 14 weeks. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\\nTim Cook: Thank you. Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $119.6 billion for the December quarter, up 2% from a year ago despite having one less week in the quarter. EPS was $2.18, up 16% from a year ago and an all-time record. We achieved revenue records across more than two dozen countries and regions including all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in many emerging markets with all-time records in Malaysia, Mexico, The Philippines, Poland, and Turkey, as well as December quarter records in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record with paid subscriptions growing double-digits year-over-year. And I'm pleased to announce today that we have set a new record for our installed base, which has now surpassed 2.2 billion active devices. We are announcing these results on the eve of what is sure to be a historic day as we enter the era of spatial computing. Starting tomorrow, Apple Vision Pro, the most advanced personal electronics device ever, will be available in Apple stores for customers in the U.S. with expansion to other countries later this year. Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary device built on decades of Apple innovation and it's years ahead of anything else. Apple Vision Pro has a groundbreaking new input system and thousands of innovations, and it will unlock incredible experiences for users and developers that are simply not possible on any other device. There is already so much excitement behind this product from reviewers, customers, and developers. They are praising everything from the incredible experience of watching a movie on a 100-foot screen to remarkable new machine learning capabilities like hand tracking and room mapping. We can't wait for people to experience the magic for themselves. Moments like these are what we live for at Apple. They're why we do what we do. They're why we're so unflinchingly dedicated to groundbreaking innovation and why we're so focused on pushing technology to its limits as we work to enrich the lives of our users. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year. Now, let's turn to the results for the December quarter, beginning with iPhone. We are proud to report that revenue came in at $69.7 billion, 6% higher than a year ago. The iPhone 15 lineup has earned glowing reviews and been embraced by customers. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous new design with color-infused back glass and contoured edges, Dynamic Island, A16 Bionic, and a new 48 megapixel camera system. And the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max set the gold standard for smartphones with a beautiful and lighter titanium design, industry-leading performance with A17 Pro and our most advanced camera system with the equivalent of seven pro lenses and the ability to record spatial video. Features like Emergency SoS and roadside assistance via satellite bring peace of mind to users when they travel, and I'm grateful for every note I've received about their lifesaving impact. Turning to Mac. Revenue came in at $7.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our latest M3-powered MacBook Pro models in spite of having one less week of sales. Just last week, we got to wish Mac a happy 40th birthday. When it was introduced 40 years ago, Mac changed everything, and through the years, it has done so again and again. Recently, we have been on a tremendous pace of innovation. Since the introduction of Apple silicon in 2020, we've been proud to offer our users unmatched performance and power along with a remarkable Neural Engine for artificial intelligence and machine learning. This past fall, we had an amazing launch of the latest generation of Apple silicon for Mac, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. These chips break new ground in power and performance empowering users to do more than they ever could before, whether they're making a musical masterpiece using the latest features in Logic Pro, or beating their high score in a graphics intensive game. A favorite amongst students, business owners, artists, and video editors, our MacBook Pro lineup is the world's best pro notebook family. And iMac, the world's most capable and best-selling all-in one, is now faster than ever, thanks to M3. In iPad, revenue for the December quarter was $7 billion, down 25% year-over-year due to a difficult compare with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the 10th generation iPad during the December quarter last year and one less week of sales. iPad remains the most versatile, capable, and elegant tablet on the market today. It continues to be the go-to-device for students, creators, and more with customers loving iPad's incredible combination of portability and performance. Powerful apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad allow video and music creators to unleash their creativity in new ways that are only possible on iPad. iPad continues to push the boundaries of what's possible on a tablet. In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue came in at $12 billion, down 11% from a year ago due to a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14th week last year. Across our latest Apple Watch lineup, we're enabling and encouraging our users to live a healthier day, while making Apple Watch even more intuitive to use. The new double tap gesture on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 make it easier to answer calls, play and pause music or take a photo with iPhone. I've been deeply moved by the many touching stories about how features like a regular rhythm notification and fall detection helped Apple Watch users when they needed it most. And for the first time ever, users can choose a carbon-neutral option of any new Apple Watch. Meanwhile, our AirPods lineup continue to be a holiday favorite. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record of $23.1 billion and an 11% year-over-year increase. Because we had one less week this quarter, this growth represents an acceleration from the September quarter, and we achieved all-time revenue records across advertising, cloud services, payment services and video, as well as December quarter records in App Store and AppleCare. Across our services, we're constantly growing our offerings to give users even more to love. With the redesigned Apple TV app, we've made it easier for subscribers to enjoy all their favorite shows, movies and sports, including Apple TV+ hits like Masters of the Air, Monarch, and Slow Horses. We're proud to be a part of Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a film that has moved audiences and earned more than 200 accolades including Best Film of the Year from the New York Film Critics Circle, nine BAFTA nominations, a Golden Globe win, and 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Across all Apple TV+ productions, we've now earned 2050 award nominations and 450 wins since we've introduced the service. We're also excited to have a new season of Major League Soccer kicking off this month. We're looking forward to seeing Lionel Messi return to the field and to following all of our favorite teams in what is sure to be an incredible season. And we're counting down to the Apple Music Super Bowl halftime show, featuring Usher. Turning to Retail. In recent months, we opened three stores, including our 100th store in Asia-Pacific. Throughout the holidays, our team members pulled out all the stops to help customers find the perfect gift. And I know our U.S. team members are especially excited to begin demoing Apple Vision Pro for our customers tomorrow. At Apple, we live and breathe innovation. We are driven to pioneer new technology that can enrich our customers' lives, and we're just as intentional about showing up with our values and being a force for good in the world. February is Black History Month, and to honor it, we've launched our new Black Unity Collection, which includes the Black Unity Sport Loop band. This year's designs reflect a lasting commitment to working toward a more equitable world. We also continue to do a central work through our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, and we're proud to continue providing grants to organizations that are making a real impact in the world. In recent months, we've also taken significant strides in our environmental work. We're partnering with suppliers to bring more clean energy online for Apple production. We're using more recycled materials than ever before and more energy-efficient transportation than ever before. And each day, we are taking more and more steps toward becoming 100% carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030. Apple is a company that has never shied away from big challenges. That's because we are grounded by a deep sense of purpose and guided by core belief in the transformative power of innovation. And so, we are optimistic about the future, confident in the long-term, and as excited as we've ever been to deliver for our users like only Apple can. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $119.6 billion, up 2% from last year. During the December quarter a year ago, two unique factors affected our results. First, we had an additional week in the quarter. And second, we had COVID-related factory shutdowns that limited iPhone supply. We estimate that the net impact of these two factors resulted in a 2 percentage point headwind to our revenue performance this quarter. We set all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific, and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets with double-digit growth in the majority of the emerging markets we track. Products revenue was $96.5 billion, flat compared to last year, driven by strength in iPhone, offset by challenging compares for iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories and one less week of sales this year across the entire portfolio. Thanks to our unparalleled customer loyalty and very strong levels of customer satisfaction, our total installed base of active devices set a new record across all products and all geographic segments, and is now over 2.2 billion active devices. Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year. When we take into account the extra week last year, this represents a sequential acceleration of growth from the September quarter. We are very pleased with our Services performance in both developed and emerging markets with all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific. Company gross margin was 45.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 39.4%, up 280 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 72.8%, up 190 basis points from last quarter, due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.5 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 1% year-over-year. Net income was $33.9 billion, up $3.9 billion from last year. Diluted EPS was $2.18, up 16% versus last year and an all-time record. And operating cash flow was very strong at $39.9 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We set all-time records in several countries and regions, including Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, and Korea, as well as December quarter records in India and Indonesia. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, and we had an all-time record number of iPhone upgraders during the quarter. Customers are loving their new iPhone 15 family, with the latest reports from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 99% in the U.S. In fact, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world during the quarter. According to a survey from Kantar, iPhones were four out of the top five models in the U.S. and Japan, four out of the top six models in urban China and the UK, and all top five models in Australia. Mac generated revenue of $7.8 billion and return to growth, despite one less week of sales this year. This represents a significant acceleration from the September quarter when we faced a challenging compare due to the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Customer response to our latest iMac and MacBook Pro models powered by the M3 chips has been great. And our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter being new to the product. Also, 451 Research recently reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S. iPad was $7 billion in revenue, down 25% year-over-year. iPad faced a difficult compare because during the December quarter last year, we launched the new iPad Pro and iPad 10 generation, and we had an extra week of sales. However, the iPad installed base continues to grow and is an all-time high with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product, and customer satisfaction for iPad was recently measured at 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $12 billion, down 11% year-over-year due to a challenging launch compare and the extra week a year ago. This time last year, we had the full quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. We continue to attract new customers to Apple Watch. Nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product, and the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the U.S. And in Services, we were very pleased with our double-digit growth, which was driven by the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base is now over 2.2 billion active devices and continues to grow nicely, establishing a solid foundation for the future expansion of our Services business. And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Also, our paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. Finally, we continue to build on the breadth and the quality of our current services. From Oscar-nominated theatrical releases with Apple TV+ to more publications or News+ like The Atlantic and exciting new games on Arcade. Turning to Enterprise, we continue to see many business customers leverage Apple products to improve productivity and drive innovation. Target recently added the latest M3 MacBook Pro to their existing deployment of thousands of Mac’s, enabling employees across various departments to do their best work. In emerging markets, Zoho, a leading technology company headquartered in India, offers its 15,000 plus global employees a choice of devices, with 80% of their workforce using iPhone for work and nearly two-thirds of them choosing Mac as their primary computer. With the upcoming launch of Apple Vision Pro, we are seeing strong excitement in Enterprise. Leading organizations across many industries such as Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg, and SAP have started leveraging and investing in Apple Vision Pro as their new platform to bring innovative spatial computing experiences to their customers and employees. From everyday productivity to collaborative product design to immersive training, we cannot wait to see the amazing things our enterprise customers will create in the months and years to come. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $173 billion in cash and marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $65 billion at the end of the quarter, and our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20.5 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 6 million shares in the final settlement of our 19th ASR. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results at the end of this quarter. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. And we expect foreign exchange to be a revenue headwind of about 2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, in the December quarter a year ago, we faced significant supply constraints on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max due to COVID-19 factory shutdowns. And in the March quarter a year ago, we were able to replenish channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the constraints. We estimate that this impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter's total revenue last year. When we remove this impact from last year's revenue, we expect both our March quarter total company revenue and iPhone revenue to be similar to a year ago. For our Services business, we expect a similar double-digit growth rate to what we reported in the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on February 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?\\nOperator: Certainly. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\nErik Woodring: Hey guys, good evening. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. And congrats on the nice quarter here. Luca, maybe if we start with you. Can you unpackage some of the Services drivers a bit for us. Obviously, really nice outperformance in the December quarter versus your expectations. A record gross margin implies your higher margin businesses were likely the sources of outperformance. But can you maybe just clarify a bit how we should think about Services growth for the March quarter? And then, speak to some of those underlying drivers in the December quarter and then in the March quarter, what the different puts and takes would be? And then, I have a follow-up please. Thank you.\\nLuca Maestri: Thanks, Erik, for the question. Let's start with the December quarter. As we said, up 11%, $23.1 billion is an all-time record for us, with all-time records in The Americas, in Europe, and the rest of Asia Pac. So it was pretty broad-based geographically, and very strong across all the Services categories, because we had all-time revenue records for cloud, for payments, for video, and for advertising and December quarter records for the App Store and for AppleCare. Obviously, last year, we had an extra week, so the 11% is stronger than -- the underlying performance is stronger than the 11% that we have reported. I think the entire ecosystem is doing well because we continue to see growth and new all-time highs in both transacting accounts and paid accounts, which is obviously very important. And paid subscriptions continue to grow strong double-digits. Just as a reference, we have more than a billion paid subscriptions across all the services on our platform. This is more than double the number of paid subscriptions that we had only four years ago. So, obviously, very significant growth there. What I said during the prepared remarks around the March quarter, I mentioned that we will continue to grow double-digits at a percentage that is similar to what we reported for the December quarter. We don't provide guidance around the different services categories. So, we will provide more color when we report in three months.\\nErik Woodring: Okay. Thank you, Luca. And then, Tim, really nice to see your installed base reach a record high, again, against all products and geos. I'm wondering if you could share a bit more detail about the new users you were able to on-board over the last 12 months. Meaning, how might this new cohort look different from past cohorts, either in terms of geographic representation or SKU to certain products or even how their monetization trends might differ from past cohorts. And that's it from me. Thanks so much.\\nTim Cook: Yes. Hi, Erik. I would say emerging markets are -- have been a very key area of strength for us. If you look at it, India grew -- in revenue terms grew strong double-digits in the December quarter and hit a quarter revenue record. The other emerging markets like Indonesia also hit a quarterly record. And we had several regions, with records from Latin America to the Middle East. And that theme has been pretty consistent across the other quarters that -- of the year as well. And so, emerging markets, very, very important. And I feel like we are doing a great job there.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Erik. Operator, can we have the next question please?\\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\\nMike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. I just have two questions as well. First, on Services. Just on the outlook for the March quarter for a similar double-digit growth rate as of December quarter. I'm just wondering why not -- why won't it be potentially faster, given that the December quarter obviously had a headwind from the extra week comp, and I'd also think that some of the pricing uplifts on select Apple One services that were implemented last winter should help in the March quarter? Any additional thoughts there would be great in terms of what some of your assumptions are. And then, I have a quick follow-up.\\nLuca Maestri: Yes. We'll see how the quarter develops. I would point to two things. One is the fact that we mentioned that we expect a couple of points of negative foreign exchange in the March quarter, and foreign exchange was essentially flat for us in the December quarter. So, you've got a bit of a headwind there. And then, when you look at our other progression of our Services business over the last few quarters, the compares for March are slightly more difficult than the compares for December.\\nMike Ng: Great. Thank you, Luca. And then, my second question. It was very interesting to hear about some of the enterprise customer investments into Vision Pro. Could you maybe just talk about some of the efforts to support Vision Pro developer ecosystem. And it was also good to hear about the potential upcoming announcements on AI. So any thoughts there would also be helpful. Thank you.\\nTim Cook: Yeah. Hi. It's -- we are incredibly excited about the Enterprise opportunities with Vision Pro. I've seen several demos from different companies. Luca mentioned several in his opening remarks, but Walmart has a very cool merchandising app. There are firms that are doing collaboration -- design collaboration apps. There are field service applications. Really all over the map, there are applications that are for control center, command center kind of things. SAP has really gotten behind it and, of course, SAP is in so many of companies. I think there will be a great opportunity for us in Enterprise, and we couldn't be more excited about where things are right now. We are obviously looking forward to tomorrow. This has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across Apple. And really, it took a whole of company effort to bring it to this far. In terms of generative AI, which, I'd guess, is your focus, we have a lot of work going on internally as I've alluded to before. Our MO, if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves. And so, we're going to hold that to this as well. But we've got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we'll be talking about later this year.\\nMike Ng: Wonderful. Thank you, Tim.\\nTim Cook: Yes.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question please?\\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. I have two questions as well. First on iPhone. There have been concerns around replacement cycles lengthening, China competition intensifying, and you still beat iPhone revenues despite the weaker performance in China. Curious how you're thinking about the 15 cycle overall, given what you saw in the December quarter. And I've a follow-up.\\nTim Cook: Hi, it's Tim. The -- we were up 6%, as we mentioned in the opening remarks. We are happy with that performance. Underneath there, we had really strong performance in several parts of the world with all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific. As I mentioned earlier, we did particularly well in several emerging markets from Latin America to the Middle East. And we set December quarter records in India and Indonesia. And so, really some spectacular broad-based reactions to iPhone. We also importantly set an all-time record worldwide for iPhone upgraders. And the installed base hit a new all-time high consistent with the -- our overall devices. And so, there's lot of good things. Luca mentioned in his opening comments that iPhones were four out of the top five smartphone models in the U.S. and Japan and four out of the top six in urban China and the UK, and all top five in Australia, and the customer satisfaction level for iPhone 15 hit 99%. If you look at iPhone 15 since the announcement of it and shipment in September, so this is including some of Q4 and you compare that to iPhone 14 over the same period of time, iPhone 15 is outselling iPhone 14. And so, we feel very good about that, and the upgraders hitting a record is particularly exciting for us.\\nWamsi Mohan: Great. Thank you, Tim. And as a follow-up, obviously, you're just launching the Vision Pro and it's an entirely new category. It's a price point that's a much higher starting price point relative to most of your other, probably over the last decade, product introductions, but just wondering how would you measure the success of Vision Pro over time and which Apple products adoption curve would you look at as potentially the most similar? And is there a way in which we could think Vision Pro could eclipse maybe something like the iPad in revenue over time. Thank you.\\nTim Cook: You know, each product has its own journey. And so, I wouldn't want to compare it to any one in particular. I would just say we couldn't be more excited. Internally, we've got an incredible amount of excitement from developers and from customers that can't wait till tomorrow to pick up their units. And we are incredibly proud to be able to demo the unit in so many of our stores in the U.S. starting tomorrow for people that are -- that want to check it out. And so, we'll see and report the results of it in the Wearables category that you're familiar with. I think that if you look at it from a price point of view, there's an incredible amount of technology that's packed into the product. There's 5,000 patents in the product and it's, of course, built on many innovations that Apple has spent multiple years on, from silicon to displays and significant AI and machine learning. All the hand tracking, the room mapping, all of this stuff is driven by AI. And so, we're incredibly excited about it. I can't wait to be in the store for tomorrow and see the reaction myself.\\nWamsi Mohan: Thank you so much, Tim.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Wamsi. Operator, we'll take the next question please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon. I have two as well. I guess, first off, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in China right now. I think from a geographic basis, one of the few places that was down double-digits, while everything else was growing. So, I'm hoping you spend a bit of time discussing what are you seeing there from a competitive perspective and more importantly, from a demand perspective in China?\\nTim Cook: Yeah. If you look at iPhone in China Mainland, which I think has been the focus of a lot of interest, and you look at it in constant currency, so more of an operational view, we were down mid-single digits on iPhone. And so, it was the other things that drove the larger contraction year-over-year. On the good news side, we had solid growth on upgraders year-over-year in Mainland China and we had four of the top six smartphone models in urban China. Also, IDC just put out a note, that you may have seen, that we were the top brand in -- for the full year and for the December quarter. And so, there's some good news along with – obviously, we'd prefer not to [contract] (ph).\\nAmit Daryanani: Fair enough. And then, as a follow-up, you folks have implemented a fair bit of changes around the App Store in Europe post the DMA implementation there. Can you just touch on what are some of the key updates? And then, Luca, as a net of it all, do you see it having any significant impact financially to your services or a broader Apple P&L statement? Thank you.\\nTim Cook: Yes. You know, the -- let me try to answer a little bit of both and then Luca can add some comments to it. We announced a number of changes last week in Europe that would be in effect beginning in March. So, the last month of the first calendar quarter, the second fiscal quarter. Those are -- some of the things that we announced include alternate billing opportunities, alternate app stores, our marketplaces, if you will. We're also opening NFC for new capabilities for banking and wallet apps. And so, these are some of the things we announced. The -- if you think about what we've done over the years is, we've really majored on privacy, security, and usability. And we've tried our best to get as close to the past in terms of the things that are -- that people love about our ecosystem as we can, but we are going to fall short of providing the maximum amount that we could supply, because we need to comply with the regulation. And so, in terms of predicting the choices that developers and users will make, it's very difficult to do that with precision. And so, I will see what happens in March.\\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Amit. As Tim said, these are changes that we're going to be implementing in March. A lot will depend on the choices that will be made. Just to keep it in context, the changes applied to the EU market, which represents roughly 7% of our global app store revenue.\\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. That's a really good perspective to have. Thank you very much.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Amit. Operator, can we have the next question please?\\nOperator: Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I have two as well as you would imagine. I guess, the first question I wanted to just ask maybe unpack a little bit more, just remarkable trends that we're seeing in your product gross margin specifically. So, I'm curious as we look forward, I guess on this last quarter, where there any kind of benefits you're seeing from like just the purchase component, obligations that you've put in place, let's say, a year ago, and that flowing through. And how are you thinking about the component pricing environment as we think about that gross margin into the March quarter and looking-forward?\\nLuca Maestri: Yes. On the product side and then maybe I'll make a comment in total for the company. On the product side, our gross margins increased sequentially 280 basis points. So, obviously, a very significant increase. I would say the two primary components of the increase are a favorable mix. Of course, iPhone did very well. We did very well with our high-end models. And leverage, of course, it's the biggest quarter of the year for us and so we get the leverage effect. We had a partial offset, negative impact from foreign exchange. But net-net, obviously, very significant improvement. And we had very similar dynamics on the Services side where we increased sequentially 190 basis points, also, in this case, due to a more favorable mix. And so, the combined effect of the two businesses gave us the 45.9% at the total company level, which is up 70% sequentially. You've heard from my prepared remarks that we are guiding total company gross margin to 46% to 47%, which is an additional expansion of margins compared to the already very strong results of the December quarter.\\nAaron Rakers: Okay. And then, the second question I was just going to ask. Tim, you alluded to kind of your excitement around generative AI and some announcements that we should think about maybe later this year. One of the things that stands out for me is that, your capital expenditures has actually come down this last year. I'm curious as you look to lean in more to generative AI, is there something we should consider about the CapEx intensity at Apple to make investments to really set the table for generative AI, kind of platform as we move forward? Just given some of the things that we've seen from some other large tech companies.\\nLuca Maestri: I'll take the question, Aaron. We've always said, we will never underinvest in the business. So, we are making all the investments that are necessary throughout our product development, software development, services development. And so, we will continue to invest in every area of the business and at the appropriate level. And we're very excited about what's in store for us for the rest of the year.\\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Aaron. Operator, can we have the next question please?\\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nKrish Sankar: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one for Luca, a clarification on a question. The $5 billion impact in March quarter, is that for product revenue or is that total company revenue. And along the same part, you highlighted the strong gross margins. And I understand last year, some of the commodity costs were deflationary, buy looks like it’s going to be inflationary right now. And also you've done some of the Mac conversions that -- the silicon conversions. So I'm just trying to figure out how much juice is there more to squeeze on the gross margin side? And then I'll follow up for Tim.\\nLuca Maestri: Yes. The -- so the first part of the question was around -- oh, the $5 billion. The $5 billion, as I mentioned, a year ago we had this disruption of supply on iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max because of the factory shutdown due to the COVID-19 situation. And so, essentially there was pent up demand as we exited December quarter, they got fulfilled and we also did the channel fill associated with it during the March quarter. So close to $5 billion that I mentioned is entirely related to iPhone. On the gross margin side, obviously, we are at very high levels of gross margin. And I'll repeat what I said before, we've had good expansion over the last few quarters and now we are guiding to 46% to 47% and that takes into account everything that is going on, which is, the commodity environment, which is the foreign exchange situation, and obviously the product and services mix. And the outcome of this is the guidance, which obviously is very strong and we're very happy with it.\\nKrish Sankar: Thanks a lot, Luca. And then I have a follow-up for Tim. Tim, it was very interesting to hear your comments on enterprise. And historically, Apple has been a consumer centric company. And now with Vision Pro, Mac, it's sort of penetrating more into the enterprise. I'm kind of curious how to think about Apple of the future? Would it still be consumer centric or do you think it's going to be more enterprise focused also as we get into the future? Thank you very much.\\nTim Cook: We've really concluded that we can do both. That if you look at it, what has happened over the last several years is that, employees are in a position in many companies to choose their own technology that is the best for them. And so, it sort of took some of the central command from the traditional company and decentralized the decision-making. That is a huge advantage for Apple, because there's a lot of people out there that want to use a Mac. They're using a Mac at home. They'd like to use one in the office as well. iPad has also benefited from that. Vision Pro, it's -- when you look at the ton of use cases, I mean, we're starting with a million apps and 600 plus that are -- have been designed particularly for Vision Pro. When I look at what is coming out of Enterprise, it's some of the most innovative things I've seen come out of Enterprise in a long time. And so, I think there's a like there is for the Mac and iPad, and of course, iPhone has been in enterprise since the early days of iPhone. I think there's a nice opportunity there for Vision Pro as well.\\nKrish Sankar: Great. Thanks a lot Tim. Very interesting to hear. Thank you.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks guys. And I have two questions as well. So, Tim and Luke, I appreciate the strength in the emerging markets like India and the other names that you kind of listed on the call, but can you maybe spend some time on the Americas? Obviously, that was relatively flat, you touched on China, but what are you seeing in that market from the carriers here in the States? And is the sales cycle elongating or the replacement cycle elongating? And in your view what has to change to kind of maybe re-accelerate that business in the America's, particular in the iPhone business? And then on sort of -- I just want to make sure I understand sort of the guide. So when I think about the $5 billion pull forward last year in the March quarter from a channel fill perspective, even if I back it out last quarter or I back it up this quarter, the March quarter, this would be sort of the softest quarter since the COVID pandemic. Obviously, I know the Americas as I just touched on is a little bit softer than China, which you cleared up earlier. But how do you think about the differences in sort of the macro conditions by region? And again, do you have a sense for are we nearing a trough from a macro demand perspective or how long do you think this particular weakness persists? Thanks.\\nTim Cook: Let me take the first part of your question about America. If you look at the U.S., which obviously drives the vast, vast majority of the revenue in America, we grew in the December quarter from an iPhone business point of view and the install base hit an all-time high. If you look at the replacement cycle, it's very difficult to measure the replacement cycle at any given point. And so, what we focus on internally a lot is the active install base and the -- obviously, the sales over usually a cycle and we feel better about those things. If you look at the -- who's selling what in the U.S., the iPhone is four out of the top five selling smartphones in the US. And of course, the customer satisfaction in the U.S. as we alluded to earlier is 99%. So we feel very, very good about what our position is in the U.S.\\nLuca Maestri: And I would add to that, keep in mind, obviously, the extra week that we had a year ago that obviously makes the compare more -- a bit distorted. On the March quarter guide, I would point to you that, obviously, the COVID years had a lot of, let's say, turmoil in it, a lot of volatility that typically you wouldn't see. If you look at our sequential progression from December to March this year versus pre-COVID versus like a more normal environment, it's actually stronger than those years.\\nDavid Vogt: Got it. Thanks, guys.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, David. Operator, can we have the last question, please?\\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\\nBen Reitzes: Yes. Hi. Thanks. Appreciate it. Two questions, if I can sneak them in. Just wanted to clarify on China. Tim, I think last quarter you still thought it was a growth market. Obviously, there's some concerns with the -- recently and given what we saw in the quarter, is there something that we can kind of point to where you feel that that market can resume growth in the future? And I'm wondering if you're still upbeat about that prospect. And then I just have a quick follow up.\\nTim Cook: Ben, we've been in China for 30 years. And I remain very optimistic about China over the long term. And I feel good about hitting a new install base number, high watermark and very good about the growth in upgraders year-over-year during the quarter.\\nBen Reitzes: Great. Thanks Tim. And just in terms of AI, I know you're not going to talk about your plans, but do you believe -- are you a believer in the edge thesis that AI and processing on smartphones and devices like yours is going to have a huge role in AI and AI apps and that it's something you guys can take advantage of.\\nTim Cook: Let me just say that, I think there's a huge opportunity for Apple with GenAI and AI. And without getting into to more details and getting out in front of myself.\\nBen Reitzes: Thanks Tim.\\nTim Cook: Yes, Thanks, Ben.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you Ben.

Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $89.5 billion for the September quarter. We achieved an all-time revenue record in India, as well as September quarter records in several countries, including Brazil, Canada, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the UAE, Vietnam and more. iPhone revenue came in ahead of our expectations, setting a September quarter record, as well as quarterly records in many markets, including China mainland, Latin America, the Middle-East, South Asia and an all-time record in India. In services, we set an all-time revenue record with double-digit growth and ahead of our expectations. During the September quarter, we continue to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including foreign exchange headwinds and we've navigated these challenges by following the same principles that have always guided us. We've continued to invest in the future and manage for the long-term. We've adapted continuously to circumstances beyond our control, while being thoughtful and deliberate on spending. And we've carved a path of groundbreaking innovations and delivered with excellence every step of the way. That includes Apple Vision Pro, which has gotten such an amazing response from developers who are currently creating truly incredible apps. We're excited to get this magical product in the hands of customers early next year. Now let me share more about our products, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $43.8 billion, 3% higher than a year ago, and a new record for the September quarter. This fall, we were thrilled to debut the iPhone 15 lineup. The all-new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous design, powerful cameras and the intuitive Dynamic Island. Powered by the industry-leading A17 Pro, our iPhone15 Pro lineup has a beautiful strong and durable titanium design and the best iPhone camera system ever, including a 5X Telephoto lens on iPhone 15 Pro Max. Customers are loving the entire iPhone 15 family and reviews have been off the charts. In Mac, revenue came in at $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year from the prior year's record quarter. This was due to challenging market conditions, as well as difficult compares against the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Earlier this week, we were excited to unveil the next generation of Apple silicon with our incredible family of M3 chips, M3; M3 Pro; and M3 Max. We're continuing to innovate at a tremendous pace. And our industry-leading lineup of personal computers just got even better. The new MacBook Pro lineup brings our most advanced technology to our Pro users, while iMac, the world's best-selling all-in-one, just got faster and more capable. And according to the latest data from Student Monitor, nearly two out of three college students chose a Mac. We couldn't be more excited about the future. Turning to iPad. Revenue for the September quarter was $6.4 billion. iPad sets the gold standard for tablets and our competitors are unable to match the iPad experience that is enabled by our seamless integration of hardware and software. iPad is also our most versatile product. In classrooms around the world, it's helping educators bring lessons to life, while giving students a window into the world around them. And in artist workshops, design studios and everywhere else, creative minds come together, iPad supercharges the creative process, helping users take their ideas farther than they ever could before. Across wearables, home and accessories, revenue came in at $9.3 billion. Apple Watch has become essential in our lives and this is our best Apple Watch lineup ever. With Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, we're giving people even more tools to stay safe and live healthy, active lives. With the new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just one hand and without touching the display. It feels like magic. Our latest Apple Watch lineup also includes our first-ever carbon-neutral products, a significant achievement of innovation and determination. Apple's unique ecosystem of hardware, software, and services delivers an unparalleled user experience. During the quarter, we also had the chance to introduce a range of exciting new updates to our software that will allow users to get even more out of their devices. Whether it's personalized contact posters and new face time features in iOS 17, new tools for users to make their experience their own in macOS Sonoma and iPadOS 17, or a bold new look in watchOS 10 that lets you see and do more, faster than ever, Apple is delivering an even better, richer experience that users are loving. Services revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase. We achieved all-time revenue records across App Store, advertising, AppleCare, iCloud, payment services, and video, as well as the September quarter revenue record in Apple Music. Whether subscribers are waking up to headlines on Apple News+, getting their morning workout in with Fitness+, feeling the beat with Apple Music on their way to work or school, or unwinding at the end of the day with Apple Arcade, we have so many different services to enrich their day. Apple TV+ continues to delight customers as well, with new and returning shows like the Morning Show, Lessons in Chemistry and Monarch. We're telling impactful stories that inspire imagination and stir the soul. Making movies that make a difference is also at the heart of Apple TV+ and we were thrilled to produce Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a powerful work of cinema that premiered in theaters around the world last month. We're proud to say that since launch, just over four years ago, Apple TV+ has earned nearly 1,600 award nominations and nearly 400 wins. We also offer subscribers an unprecedented live sports experience with MLS Season Pass. We couldn't be more pleased with how our partnership with Major League Soccer has gone in its first year. Subscriptions to MLS Season Pass have exceeded our expectations and we're excited to continue that momentum next year. With the playoffs now underway, we can't wait to see who takes home MLS cup. And nowhere does the magic of Apple come alive more than it does in our stores. Over the past year, we've continued to find ways to connect with even more customers. We welcomed customers to our first-ever retail locations in India. We also opened doors to new stores in Korea, China and the UK and expanded the Apple store online to Vietnam and Chile. And we have another store opening in China this week. In September, I joined our team at Apple Fifth Avenue on launch day and the energy and excitement were unbelievable. Every time we connect with the customer, we're reminded why we do what we do. From simple joys of creating and sharing memories, to lifesaving features like emergency SoS via satellite, we're enriching lives in ways large and small. And whether we're working to safeguard user privacy, ensure technology made by Apple is accessible for everyone, or build an even more inclusive workplace, we're determined to lead with our values. Our environmental efforts are a great example of the intersection of our work and our values. Across Apple, we act on a simple premise, the best products in the world should be the best products for the world. We've made our environmental work a central focus of our innovation, because we feel a responsibility to leave the world better than we found it and because we know that climate change cannot be stopped, unless everyone steps up and does their part. Our first ever carbon-neutral products represent a major milestone and we're going to go even further. We plan to make every product across our lineup carbon neutral by the end of the decade. And we're not doing it alone. Over 300 of our suppliers have committed to using a 100% clean energy for Apple production by 2030. We also continue to invest in entrepreneurs who are lighting the way for a greener, more equitable future. Through our third impact accelerator class, we're proud to support a new class of diverse innovators on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy. Apple is always looking forward, driven in equal measure by a sense a possibility and a deep belief in our purpose. We're motivated by the meaningful difference we can make for our customers and keenly determined to push the limits of technology even further. And that's why I'm so confident that Apple's future is bright. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the September quarter was $89.5 billion, down less than 1% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of over 2 percentage points. And on a constant-currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total, and in each geographic segment. We set a September quarter record in the Americas and saw strong performance across our emerging markets, where both iPhone and Services grew double digits. Products revenue was $67.2 billion, down 5% from last year, due to very challenging compares on both Mac and iPad, which I will discuss in more detail later on. At the same time, we reached a September quarter record on iPhone, driven by strength in emerging markets. Our total installed-base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments, thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and many new customers joining our ecosystem. Our Services revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year, with growth accelerating sequentially from the June quarter. Our performance in Services were broad based, as we reached all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific and a September quarter record in Greater China. We also set new records in every Services category. Company gross margin set a September quarter record at 45.2%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 36.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 70.9%, up 40 basis points from last quarter due to a different mix. Operating expenses of $13.5 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided, up 2% year-over-year. Net income was $23 billion, diluted earnings per share was $1.46, up 13% versus last year and a September quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at $21.6 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $43.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year and a new September quarter record. We had strong performance in several markets, including an all-time record in India as September quarter records in Canada, Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia . Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high and fiscal 2023 was another record year for switches. We continue to see extremely high levels of customer satisfaction which 451 Research recently measured at 98% in the U.S. Mac revenue was $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year, driven by challenging market conditions and compounded by a difficult compare in our own business, whereby last year we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter and were subsequently able to fulfill significant pent-up demand during the September quarter. We also had a difference in launch timing with the MacBook Air launching earlier this year in the June quarter compared to the September quarter last year. We have great confidence in our Mac lineup and are excited about the recently announced iMac and MacBook Pro powered by our M3 chips. Our installed base is at an all-time high and half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product, driven by MacBook Air. Also, we saw reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S. iPad generated $6.4 billion in revenue, down 10% year-over-year. Similar to Mac, these results were a function of a difficult compare from the supply disruptions in the June quarter a year ago and the subsequent fulfillment of pent-up demand in the September quarter. iPad continues to attract a large number of new customers to the installed base with over half of the customers who purchase iPads during the quarter being new to the product and the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9.3 billion, down 3% year-over-year. We had a September quarter record in Europe and we saw strong performance in several emerging markets around the world. Apple Watch continues to expand its reach with nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product and customer satisfaction for the Watch was recently measured at 97% in the U.S. Services had a great quarter. We reached a new all-time revenue record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year. And we're happy to see growth coming from all categories and every geographic segment, which is a direct result of the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem. And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our Services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double-digits year-over-year, each reaching a new all-time high. Also our paid subscriptions showed strong growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, nearly double the number we had only three years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from exciting new content on Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade to additional storage tiers on iCloud. We believe our customers will love this new offering. Turning to enterprise. We are excited to see our business customers in both developed and emerging markets expand their deployment of Apple products and technologies to drive business innovation and employee satisfaction. Starbucks continuously invest in Apple technology to bring the best experience to the customers and employees, including tens of thousands of iPads across all retail stores to help their teams streamline order management, operations and training. In addition, Starbucks recently refreshed over 10,000 Macs to the latest M2-powered MacBook Air for all store managers, enabling them to do their best work and improve productivity. And in Indonesia, popular technology company GoTo is offering Mac as a choice, so that employees can have the best tools to be most productive. Today, more than half of its workforce are already choosing Mac for work. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $162 billion in cash and marketable securities. We increased commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion. As a result, net cash was $51 billion at the end of the quarter. And our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $15.5 billion through open market repurchases of 85 million Apple shares. We also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in August, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 22 million shares. Taking a step back, as we close our 2023 fiscal year, our annual revenue was $383 billion. While it was down 3% from the prior year, it grew on a constant-currency basis despite the volatile and uneven macroeconomic environment. Our year-over-year revenue performance improved each quarter as we went through the year, and so did our earnings per share performance, as we reported double-digit EPS growth in the September quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in emerging markets with revenue reaching an all-time record in fiscal 2023 and double-digit growth in constant currency. We are expanding our direct presence in these markets from new Apple retail stores in India to online stores in Vietnam and Chile. And we continue to work with our partners to offer a wide range of affordability programs so that we can best serve our customers. We're very excited about the momentum we have in these markets and the opportunity ahead of us. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Also, on foreign exchange, we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of about 1 percentage point. As a reminder, the December quarter this year will last the usual 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks. For clarity, revenue from the extra week last year added approximately 7 percentage points to the quarter's total revenue. Despite having one less week this year, we expect our December quarter, total company revenue to be similar to last year. We expect iPhone revenue to grow year-over-year on an absolute basis. We also expect to grow after normalizing for both last year's supply disruptions and the one extra week. We expect Mac year-over-year performance to significantly accelerate from the September quarter. We expect the year-over-year revenue performance for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. On iPad, we launched a new iPad Pro and iPad 10th Generation during the December quarter a year ago. For the Wearable category, last year we had the full December quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd Generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. For our Services business, we expect the average revenue per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 45% and 46%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.4 billion and $14.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $200 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax-rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock, payable on November 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\\nOperator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Mike Ng of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\\nMichael Ng: Hey. Good afternoon, and thank you very much for the questions. I just have a question on iPhone storage and demand versus iCloud. As demand for storage grows, are you seeing a mix-shift towards higher storage iPhone models or are consumers mostly opting for the same because of increased uptake of iCloud+? What are some of the strategic and financial considerations here and trade-offs, as you think about the mix shift towards higher storage models versus iCloud penetration? Thanks.\\nTim Cook: Michael, it's Tim. As you probably know, we started the line with the iPhone Pro Max at 256, and so we are seeing a different mix, if you will, this year than last year. Outside of that, not significant changes.\\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you. And as a separate follow-up, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the market conditions on notebooks and desktops, and then any color that you can share regarding the timing of the Mac -- M3 MacBook Pros this year versus the M2 earlier in the calendar year? Thank you.\\nTim Cook: Yeah. We're thrilled to have announced the M3 lineup and get the new MacBook Pro, the new iMac out there. We couldn't be more excited about it. We -- as Luca said, with the lineup that we've got and the compare issue that we don't have during Q1, we anticipate a significant acceleration in the Mac space for Q1. To just repeat a little bit about the circumstances of the performance last quarter, in the year-ago June quarter, we had a factory disruption that lasted several weeks. The pent-up demand that resulted from that was filled in the September quarter, and that made the September quarter not only a record, but a substantial record. And obviously, we're now comparing against that for '23 and so that, I wouldn't look at the negative 34% as representative of the underlying business performance. It's sort of the net of it.\\nMichael Ng: Excellent. That's very clear. Thank you, Tim.\\nTim Cook: Yeah.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thanks, Mike. Can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the execution in the quarter. I'm curious, if you could help us characterize what the demand environment you're seeing in China looks like. How has the reception been to the iPhone 15? And kind of similar question to the prior one, how would you characterize the mix within China as you go through this current product cycle? And I have a follow-up.\\nTim Cook: Yeah. If you look at how we did in Greater China for the quarter, we came in at, on a revenue basis, minus 2. But one thing to keep in mind here is that the FX impact was nearly 6 points. So we grew in constant currency. And underneath that, if you look at the different -- the categories, iPhone actually set a September quarter record in mainland China. And the -- what pulled down the performance was a combination, largely of Mac and iPad. Services also grew during the quarter and the Mac and iPad suffered from the same issues that the company did with the compare issues to factory disruptions in Q3 that were filled subsequently in Q4 of '22. We had the -- in addition to that, we had the top four selling phones in urban China for last year, and I was -- I just took a trip over there and could not be more excited about the interactions I had with the customers and employees and others.\\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. And then, as a quick follow-up, I'm curious as we move towards more of an inflationary component pricing environment. Luca, how do we think about that effect? How you're thinking about the gross margin at the product level, as maybe component pricing starts to turn, what's been clearly very favorable over the last several quarters to more of an inflationary environment? Thank you.\\nLuca Maestri: Well, as you've seen from our results in Q4 and the guidance for Q1, we're obviously experiencing very strong levels of gross margin. The 45.2% was a record for the September quarter. And then, the guidance for Q1 is obviously strong at 45% to 46%. Our gross margins are affected by multiple factors. Obviously, the commodity environment is one of them, as you mentioned. It's been a good environment in recent quarters. But equally important is the mix of what we sell. And obviously, growth in Services for us is favorable, and that has helped our company gross margin. Foreign exchange, on the other hand, has been a drag for us for several quarters, given the strength of the dollar. We don't provide guidance past the December quarter, which is a very important one for us because it's the beginning of the product cycle for many products. And so we feel very good, very confident about, this coming year, and I think the gross margin guidance reflects that.\\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Aaron. Can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\nErik Woodring: Awesome. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Maybe if I start, Luca, I know that the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are constrained today, but I think some of your comments suggests you should be back to supply demand balance before quarter end. So, I guess, my question is, does your December quarter revenue guidance account for any supply constraints? And if so, is there any way to kind of quantify how much supply would be limiting your December quarter revenue performance? And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you.\\nLuca Maestri: Yes. It's correct. We are constrained today on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. We're working very hard to get the product in the hands of all the customers that have ordered it. We expect, as of today, that we're going to be in supply demand balance by the end of the quarter. So the guidance reflects that.\\nErik Woodring: Okay, very clear. Thanks. And then, maybe for you and Tim. You guys have been on the leading end of -- edge of innovation across hardware, software, silicon, services. And I'm sure there's plenty of technology in kind of longer-term projects that you're investing in. How should we think about your capital intensity as we look to fiscal year '24, just given over the last few years, CapEx as a percentage of revenue had been relatively low compared to the eight years prior? So should we expect a step-up or kind of similar capital intensity? And what are the more notable moving pieces, if any, that we should be thinking about? Thanks.\\nLuca Maestri: Well, the big areas of investment for us are tooling and equipment for manufacturing plants. Our investments in data centers and our investments in our own facilities, both corporate facilities and retail stores. And so, both for the tooling in our plants and our data center investments, we tend to have a bit of a hybrid model where we share some of the investments with our partners and suppliers and so maybe that's why you see sometimes a bit of variability. But over the last few years, we've made all the investments that we needed to make. And obviously, we're planning to make all the investments that we believe are needed and appropriate in order to continue to innovate.\\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much for the color, guys.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Eric. Can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys for taking my question. I know you covered China. I want to pivot to the US for a second. Obviously, iPhone and the business looks like it returned to growth in the quarter. But it's still relatively softer kind of where I thought it would be at this point in the cycle and some of the U.S. carriers obviously haven't been that particularly aggressive in promoting upgrades. So just wanted to kind of get a sense, first, what you're seeing from your partners in the U.S. kind of currently and going forward and what do you expect? And then, second, Luca, on the margins, I mean, is it fair to say that the mix in Q1 from a product versus services dynamic is kind of the key driver of the better gross margin guide as a whole relative to, let's say, the December quarter? Or is there anything else? I know you mentioned there's a lot of moving pieces, but is that the primary driver of the uplift in the margin? Thanks.\\nTim Cook: On the U.S. carriers and the U.S. business in general, it's really too early to call the iPhone cycle, particularly with the constraint around the Pro and the Pro Max and the U.S. tends to do quite well with those products. It's really too early to tell what the upgrade rates will be and what the switcher rates will be.\\nLuca Maestri: On the margin side, if I understood your question correctly about the December quarter guidance, keep in mind that actually December is the quarter where our products business is tends to be very heavy because of the holiday season. And so the services gross margins that are accretive to total company had an impact, but not as meaningful as other quarters during the year and so I think that the main drivers of the guidance that we provided are the fact that we are seeing improved costs, and improved mix on our -- on the product side of the business, partially offset by foreign exchange, which continues to be a drag, both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis.\\nDavid Vogt: Got it. So the weakness in iPad and Wearables are less of an impact on sort of the margin trajectory in the December quarter?\\nLuca Maestri: That's correct.\\nDavid Vogt: I guess?\\nLuca Maestri: That's correct.\\nDavid Vogt: Got it. Thanks, Luca.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thanks, David. We'll take our next question, please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\\nAmit Daryanani: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess, first off, just the Services growth rate, there's a tremendous acceleration I think in September quarter, the 16% growth. And it sounds like it’s going to hold there pretty well into December. Can you just talk about what is driving this acceleration? Are there a couple of products that have just stepped up in a very meaningful way? Just maybe flush out like what is driving this acceleration because it's fairly notable compared to what you've been seeing in the last few quarters.\\nLuca Maestri: We had a really strong quarter across the border, Amit, because both geographically and from a product category standpoint, we saw very significant growth, I mentioned the records on a geographic basis. And from a category standpoint, literally, we set records in each one of the big categories. We had all-time record for App Store, for advertising, for cloud, video, AppleCare, payments and a September quarter record for Music. So it's hard to pick, one in particular because they all did well. And really then, we step back and we think about why is it that our Services business is doing well and it's because we have an installed base of customers that continues to grow at a very nice space and the engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow. We have more transacting accounts, we have more paid accounts, we have more subscriptions on the platform and we continue to add. We continue to add content and features. We're adding a lot of content on TV+, new games on Apple Arcade, new features, new storage plans for iCloud. So it's a combination of all these things and the fact that the engagement in the ecosystem is improving, and therefore, it benefits every service category.\\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. That's really helpful. And then, maybe if I could ask you about Vision Pro, which I believe is supposed to be launched more broadly sometime in 2024, in the early part of the year. I'm curious how different do you think the launch and the consumer education of this product or a new category will be versus other things like AirPods or Apple Watch that you've done. And then, perhaps any themes I think that's set out to you from the developers that have been able to use this and the developer labs, what feedback have you gotten from them?\\nTim Cook: Yeah. That's a great question. There is a tremendous amount of excitement around the Vision Pro and we're -- we've been very happy to share it with developers, and we have developer labs set up in different parts of the world so that they can actually get their hands on it and are working on apps and I've been fortunate enough to see a number of those. And there is some real blow away kinds of things that are coming out, and so that all looks good. To answer your question about is it similar to AirPods or Apple Watch, I would say, no. There's never been a product like the Vision Pro. And so, we're purposely bringing it out in our stores only, so we can really put a great deal of attention on the last mile of it. We'll be offering demos in the stores and it will be very different process than the -- a normal grab-and-go kind of process.\\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. We'll take the next question, please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\\nHarsh Kumar: Yeah. Hey, thanks for the question and congratulations on tremendous execution in a very tough macro. Actually, Tim, the last question is a perfect segue here, given what you are doing with your Vision Pro. So lots of companies are experimenting with generative AI. I'm curious about what kind of efforts you have. I'm sure there are segues into Pro Vision that you have, but I was curious about if you can give us a glimpse on how you might be able to monetize some of these efforts of generative AI.\\nTim Cook: If you kind of zoom out and look at what we've done on AI and machine learning and how we've used it, we view AI and machine learning as fundamental technologies, and they're integral to virtually every product that we ship. And so just recently, when we shipped iOS 17, it had features like Personal Voice and Live Voicemail. AI is at the heart of these features. And then, you can go all the way to then lifesaving features on the launch end of phone like fall detection, crash detection, ECG on the watch. These would not be possible without AI. And so, we don't label them as such, if you will. We label them as to what their consumer benefit is. But at the fundamental technology behind it is AI and machine learning. In terms of generative AI, we have -- obviously, we have work going on. I'm not going to get into details about what it is, because -- as you know, we don't -- we really don't do that. But you can bet that we're investing, we're investing quite a bit, we're going to do it responsibly and it will -- you will see product advancements over time that where the -- those technologies are at the heart of them.\\nHarsh Kumar: Thanks, Tim. Very clear. And for my follow-up, I had a philosophical question. So, you guys always try to provide the best experience for consumers. To that end, I think, over the last decade you in-sourced a lot of important chips in your phones, in your Macs, iPads, so on and so forth. And that was, I think, a function that ARM wasn't around in the industry from a merchant angle. But now, we see these the silicon guys, the chip guys moving to ARM architecture. So my question to you is, has the move to internal silicon been economically profitable proposition for Apple? Or is it -- or is it a strategic one, where you simply need to own this and it's vital to your products for the consumer experience or maybe there's a path back to chip vendors at some point in time?\\nTim Cook: It's really enabled us to build products that we could not build without doing it ourselves. And as you know, we like to own the primary technologies in the products that we ship and arguably, the silicon is at the heart of the primary technologies, and so, no, I don't see going back. I am happier today than I was yesterday, than I was last week that we made the transition that we've made, and I see that benefit every day of it.\\nHarsh Kumar: Thanks, Tim.\\nTim Cook: Yeah.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Harsh. We'll take the next question, please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. Tim, over the last decade, pretty much you've gained a lot of share in China. As you look, your -- some of the domestic players are starting to re-emerge, especially in the high-end phone space. I know you touched on China. But how would you see Apple's positioning and opportunity for continued share gains, particularly in China? And how was the linearity in China from a demand perspective? And I have a follow-up, please.\\nTim Cook: In the September quarter, we set an iPhone record -- revenue record in China and we're very proud of that and we obviously grew. The market predictions that I've seen, we've had the market contracting. And so if that's -- if those are correct, then we gained share last quarter. And so we are very proud of that, I don't know what every quarter will hold. And obviously, we just give a bit of color on the current quarter. But over the long term, I view China as an incredibly important market and I'm very optimistic about it.\\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Tim. And as a follow-up, you obviously had a great Services quarter and part of your Services business has these licensing relationships with research partners, where you serve a very important distribution function for them. Can you talk about how you think about these relationships and potentially some of the options maybe Apple has to mitigate some of the risks, given some of the scrutiny on with some of the research partners? Thank you so much.\\nLuca Maestri: They are important relationships. And as you know, we don't get into our commercial relationships in the call. I see them as important and we make decisions that are in the best interest of our users or what we feel is in the best interest of our users. And that's kind of what we've done in the past and how we've -- how we'll run the show in the future as well.\\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you, Tim.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Wamsi. Can we have the next question, please.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nKrish Sankar: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I had two of them too. First one, Luca, thanks for the color on gross margin. And when I look at it over the last four quarters, even if on a year-over-year basis revenue declined, the gross margins have improved. And I understand Services definitely helped. I'm just kind of curious, when you look at on a go forward basis, are most of the big step functions and cost reductions like the Mac Silicon conversion, et cetera, that are done or is there more room for margin expansion from here? And then, I had a follow-up.\\nLuca Maestri: Well, on the product side, as you know, we -- when we launch new products, the cost structures of those products tend to be higher than the products that they replace. It happens because we are always adding new technologies, new features, and then, we worked through the cost curve over the lifecycle of the product and we tend to get benefits as time goes by. The guidance that we provided for December reflects all that and so we're starting from a better position than a year ago or than, in the past, in general. There are other factors that play a role. For example, the mix of products that we sell. Not every product has the same gross margin profile, and so our guidance, our results are reflective of that. And also, within a specific product category, a lot depends on the kind of models that we sell because they have different margin profiles. I think one of the things that we've done well over the last few years is to offer more affordability solutions to our customers in the form of instalment plans, trading options, and spend -- low-cost financing in general. And what that has accomplished is reduced the affordability threshold for our customers and therefore, they can, buy at the top of our product ranges. That has been a big factor in the reason for our margin expansion. We don't provide guidance or color past the current quarter because there's so many different variables that affect gross margins, but we obviously feel very good about the trajectory that we've had in 2023 and now, the guidance that we provide for the beginning of our fiscal '24. And we need some of these things because, obviously, their foreign exchange environment has been difficult and has been a bit of a drag for us. But net-net, we're very pleased where we are.\\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks for that, Luca. And then, I have a follow-up for Tim. Obviously, you're seeing amazing momentum in India. I'm just kind of curious how do you look at -- when you look at the India growth opportunity on these hardware units, how to think about ASP relative to that versus like the rest of the geographies? And is there a way to compare or contrast India, growth momentum versus China maybe a decade ago or so at the same point in the rollout of, the share gains in that geography?\\nTim Cook: Yeah. It's a great question. We had an all-time revenue record in India. We grew very strong double-digits. It's an incredibly exciting market for us and a major focus of ours. We have low share in a large market, and so it would seem there's a lot of headroom there. The ASPs, I haven't looked at them most recently, but I'm sure that they're lower than the worldwide. But that doesn't bother us at all. It just -- and in terms of the similarity, I would say, each country has its own journey. And I wouldn't want to play the comparison game. But we see an extraordinary market, a lot of people moving into the middle class, distribution is getting better, lots of positives. We put two retail stores there, as you know. They're doing better than we anticipated. It's still early going, but they're off to a good start and I couldn't be happier with how things are going at the moment.\\nKrish Sankar: Thanks, Tim.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. We'll now take our next question, please.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\\nBen Reitzes: Hey. Thanks a lot. I appreciate the question. Tim, I appreciate all your commentary around China. It was great to kind of hear about the growth potential there, your optimism. I wanted to also ask about the supply chain and where is your priority? Do you have a priority to diversify your supply chain? How do you feel about Apple's supply chain around the world? And in particular, what do you think about further investments in the U.S. as well?\\nTim Cook: Our supply chain is truly global, and so we're investing all over the world, including in the United States, we were very focused on advanced manufacturing for the U.S. and have worked on a number of different projects in the U.S., whether that's our venture with Corning on the glass or Face ID module or semiconductors. And so all of these are our advanced manufacturing and I think exactly the kinds of things that the U.S. would be and are very, very good at. We also invested in other regions of the world and we're continually optimizing the chain. And so we -- the moment we learned something that didn't work exactly right, we are tweaking it. And so we're going to continue to do that. But at the end of day, it will still be a global supply chain.\\nBen Reitzes: Got it. Thanks.\\nTim Cook: Yeah.\\nBen Reitzes: Next one for Luca. Just really quick on the extra week dynamic. There was also last year an issue with the iPhone production, where there was the COVID lockdowns in China. Is it possible to give some color around what that -- I guess, having a normalized supply chain somewhat this year, what that benefit is this year and maybe contrast that with the 7 point hit from the extra week? Thanks a lot.\\nLuca Maestri: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ben. I mentioned during the prepared remarks the extra week is 7 points of revenue. We did have disruptions, supply disruptions last year on the phone, on the 14 Pro and Pro Max in the December quarter a year ago. And when we normalize for those two factors, and I said it during the call, we still expect to grow on iPhone. So you take into account the, the loss of the extra week, you compare it with the supply disruptions that are not going to repeat, hopefully, this year. And when you normalize for those two things, we still expect to grow on iPhone.\\nBen Reitzes: Thanks a lot everybody. Appreciate it, Luca.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Ben. And we'll take the last question now.\\nOperator: Our last question comes from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\\nRichard Kramer: Thank you very much. Tim, first off, if we look over the past two years, Apple sales are about $18 billion higher and R&D is up by about 8% -- $8 billion or over a third higher. Can you give us a sense of some of the main components or drivers behind that increase in innovation spend? Is it Apple Silicon, is it new products like Vision Pro or is it content to support new services? I think that's one of the top questions investors have. Thanks.\\nTim Cook: Sure. It's a number of things, Richard. It's the -- some things I can't talk about, its Vision Pro, it's AI and ML, it's the silicon investment that we're making, the transition with the Mac and other silicon. It's sort of all of those things and -- but I think you would find that the R&D expenditure in the aggregate looks very competitive versus others.\\nLuca Maestri: And I would add, Richard, on this front. Some of the investments that we're making in R&D are also one of the drivers for the gross margin expansion. So I think it's important to think about it that way.\\nRichard Kramer: That's great. And Luca, you mentioned -- or Tim mentioned college students choosing Mac. Then, you mentioned the record Services revenue. What other metrics do you think you could provide to help investors understand how Apple measures and increases customer lifetime value, especially when we see a lot of users entering the ecosystem with a relatively lower-priced products or even refurbished devices? So you're growing your ecosystem, but how do you think about growing customer lifetime value over the long run?\\nLuca Maestri: Well, some of the metrics that I mentioned before, obviously, we look at the installed base of active devices. We see, we want to make sure that, the customers that we acquire remain with us and so we have good visibility over that, and we pay a lot of attention to the behavior of the installed base, both by product and by geography. And then, we look at the daily engagement in the ecosystem. So that's why we pay a lot of attention on things like transacting accounts, paid accounts, we want to see if, in fact, we are able to move our customers from a free model to a paid model over time. That's obviously very, very important for us. And so, on this, we keep track of all these things and that's -- and then what we do, because I think it's really important is that over time, we add new services and that, obviously, like, for example, the progress that we've made in payments in recent years, very, very important because we've attracted more and more people that are actually now using additional features on our devices and we are able to monetize that, right. So we take all that into account, we understand what happens when a customer joins us, when they buy a primary device versus a used device, we understand their behavior, in different markets and so on. So we have, I think, pretty good visibility. And I think the progress that we're making in Services, we did $85 billion in the last 12 months. It's -- that's a size of a Fortune 50 and significantly bigger than it was just a couple of years ago.\\nRichard Kramer: Absolutely. Thanks very much.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\\nTim Cook: Thank you, Saori. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $81.8 billion for the June quarter, better than our expectations. We continued to see strong results in emerging markets, driven by robust sales of iPhone with June quarter total revenue records in India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE. We set June quarter records in a number of other countries as well, including France, the Netherlands and Austria. And we set an all-time revenue record in Services driven by more than $1 billion paid subscriptions. We continued to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including nearly 4 percentage points of foreign exchange headwinds. On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to the prior year's quarter in aggregate and in the majority of markets we track. We continue to manage deliberately and innovate relentlessly, and we are driven by the sense of possibility those efforts inspire. To that end, before I turn to the quarter in more detail, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented innovations we were proud to announce at our Worldwide Developers Conference. In addition to extraordinary new Macs and incredible updates to our software platforms, we had the chance to introduce the world to spatial computing. We were so pleased to share the revolutionary Apple Vision Pro with the world, a bold new product unlike anything else created before. Apple Vision Pro is a marvel of engineering, built on decades of innovation only possible at Apple. It is the most advanced personal electronic device ever created, and we've been thrilled by the reaction from press, analysts, developers and content creators who've had the chance to try it. We can't wait to get it into customers' hands early next year. Now let me share more with you on our June quarter results beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $39.7 billion for the quarter, down 2% from the year ago quarter's record performance. On a constant currency basis, iPhone revenue grew, and we had a June quarter record for switchers, reflecting the popularity of the iPhone lineup. iPhone 14 customers continue to praise the exceptional battery life and essential health and safety features, while iPhone 14 Plus users are loving the new larger screen size. And with Dynamic Island, Always-On display and the most powerful camera system ever in an iPhone, the iPhone 14 Pro lineup is our best ever. Turning to Mac. We recorded $6.8 billion in revenue, down 7% year-over-year. We are proud to have completed the transition of our entire Mac lineup to run exclusively on Apple silicon. We are also excited to have introduced the new 15-inch MacBook Air during the quarter, the world's best 15-inch laptop and one of the best Macs we've ever made. And we launched 2 new powerhouses in computing, Mac Studio with M2 Max and M2 Ultra and Mac Pro with M2 Ultra, which are the most powerful Macs we've ever made. iPad revenue was $5.8 billion for the June quarter, down 20% year-over-year, in part due to a difficult compare because of the timing of the iPad Air launch last year. Customers are loving iPad's versatility and exceptional value. There was a great deal of excitement from creatives when we brought Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro to iPad this spring. And with the back-to-school season in full swing, iPad has the power to help students tackle the toughest assignments. Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $8.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. Packed with features to empower users to live a healthier life, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Ultra continue to help people take the next step on their wellness journey. As I mentioned earlier, last quarter, we held our biggest and most exciting WWDC yet. We were thrilled to welcome developers from across the globe to Apple Park, both in person and virtually, and to share some stunning new announcements with the world. In addition to Apple Vision Pro and the new Macs that we introduced, we had the chance to reveal some truly remarkable new innovations to our software platforms. From exciting new features like Live Voicemail and StandBy in iOS 17, to new tools for users to work, play and personalize their experience in macOS Sonoma and iPadOS 17, to a fresh design and new workout capabilities in watchOS 10, there's so much coming later this year to empower users to get more out of their devices, and we think they're going to instantly love these new features. It was also an exciting quarter for Services where revenue reached $21.2 billion and saw a sequential acceleration to an 8% year-over-year increase, better than we expected. We set an all-time revenue record for total services and in a number of categories, including video, AppleCare, cloud and payment services. Since we introduced Apple Pay almost a decade ago, customers have been loving how easy it is to make purchases online, in apps and in stores. We're also pleased to see Apple Card build on the success of Apple Pay. Designed with our users' financial health in mind, Apple Card has become one of the most successful credit card programs in the U.S. with award-winning customer satisfaction. And this spring, we introduced a new high-yield savings account for Apple Card customers, which has become incredibly popular, with customers already making more than $10 billion in deposits. Meanwhile, Apple TV+ continues to provide a spectacular showcase of imaginative storytelling. Recently, fans welcomed new series like Hijack and Silo as well as returning fan favorites like Foundation and The Afterparty. In the few years since its launch, Apple TV+ has earned more than 1,500 nominations and 370 wins. That includes the 54 Emmy Award nominations across 13 titles that Apple TV+ received last month. It's also been an exciting time for sports on Apple TV+. Soccer legend Lionel Messi made his debut with Major League Soccer last month, and fans all over the world tuned in with MLS Season Pass. We are excited about our MLS partnership, and we're thrilled to see Messi suiting up with Inter Miami. And just in time for summer concert season, Apple Music launched new discovery features celebrating live music, including venue guides in Apple Maps and set lists from tours of major artists. These new features and others join a lineup of updates coming later this year to make Services more powerful, more useful and more fun than ever. Everything we do is in service of our customers, and retail is where we bring the best of Apple. During the quarter, we opened the Apple Store online in Vietnam, and we're excited to connect with more customers there. We also redesigned our first-ever Apple Store located in Tysons Corner, Northern Virginia, with inclusive, innovative and sustainable design enhancements. We opened a beautiful new store beneath our new London headquarters in the historic Battersea Power Station. And the performance of the stores we opened in India this spring exceeded our initial expectations. With every product we create, every feature we develop and every interaction we share with our customers, we lead with the values we stand for. We believe in creating technology that serves all of humanity, which is why accessibility has always been a core value that we embed in everything we do. On Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we unveiled some extraordinary new tools for cognitive, vision, hearing and mobile accessibility that will be available later this year, including Assistive Access, which distills apps to their most essential features, and Personal Voice, which allows users to create a synthesized voice that sounds just like them. Building technology and service of our customers also means protecting their privacy, which we believe is a fundamental human right. That's why we were pleased to announce major updates to Safari Private Browsing, Communication Safety and Lockdown Mode to further safeguard our users. And as part of our efforts to build a better world, we announced that we've more than doubled our initial commitment to our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative to more than $200 million. We will continue to do our part to support education, economic empowerment and criminal justice reform work. And while supporting efforts to advance equity and opportunity, we continue to build a culture of belonging at Apple and a workforce that reflects the communities we serve. Through our environmental work, we're making strides in our commitment to leave the world better than we found it. Last month, Apple joined with global nonprofit Acumen in a new effort to improve livelihoods in India through clean energy innovation, and we are as committed as ever to our Apple 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across our entire supply chain and the life cycle of our products. We've long held that education is the great equalizer. With that in mind, we're expanding Apple Learning Coach, a free professional learning program that teaches educators how to get more out of Apple technology in the classroom. Today, we welcome more than 1,900 educators across the U.S. to the program. By the end of the year, we'll offer Apple Learning Coach in 12 more countries. As we're connecting with teachers, we're also celebrating the graduations of students at our app developer academies around the world. From Detroit, to Naples, to Riyadh and more, we're excited to watch these talented developers embark on careers in coding and find ways to make a positive difference in their communities. Apple remains a champion of innovation, a company fueled by boundless creativity, driven by a deep sense of mission and guided by the unshakable belief that a great idea can change the world. Looking ahead, we'll continue to manage for the long term, always pushing the limits of what's possible and always putting the customer at the center of everything we do. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the June quarter was $81.8 billion, down 1% from last year and better than our expectations despite nearly 4 percentage points of negative impact from foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total and in the majority of the markets we track. We set June quarter records in both Europe and Greater China and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets driven by iPhone. Products revenue was $60.6 billion, down 4% from last year, as we faced FX headwinds and an uneven macroeconomic environment. However, our installed base reached an all-time high across all geographic segments, driven by a June quarter record for iPhone switchers and high new-to rates in Mac, iPad and Watch, coupled with very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty. Our Services revenue set an all-time record of $21.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year and grew double digits in constant currency. Our performance was strong around the world as we reach all-time Services revenue records in Americas and Europe and June quarter records in Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific. Company gross margin was 44.5%, a record level for the June quarter and up 20 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings and favorable mix shift towards Services, partially offset by a seasonal loss of leverage. Products gross margin was 35.4%, down 130 basis points from last quarter due to seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 70.5%, decreasing 50 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses of $13.4 billion were below the low end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and decelerated from the March quarter. We continue to take a deliberate approach in managing our spend with strong focus on innovation and new product development. The results of these actions delivered net income of $19.9 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.26, up 5% versus last year, and very strong operating cash flow of $26.4 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $39.7 billion, down 2% year-over-year but grew on a constant currency basis. We set revenue records in several markets around the world, including an all-time record in India and June quarter records in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Indonesia, the Philippines, Italy, the Netherlands and the U.K. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, thanks to a June quarter record in switchers. This is a testament to our extremely high levels of customer satisfaction, which 451 Research recently measured at 98% for the iPhone 14 family in the U.S. Mac generated $6.8 billion in revenue, down 7% year-over-year. We continue to invest in our Mac portfolio. And this past quarter, we were pleased to complete the transition to Apple silicon for the entire lineup. This transition has driven both strong upgrade activity and a high number of new customers. In fact, almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product. We also saw reported customer satisfaction of 96% for Mac in the U.S. iPad revenue was $5.8 billion, down 20% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. These results were driven by a difficult compare against the full quarter impact of the iPad Air launch in the prior year. At the same time, we continue to attract a large number of new customers to the iPad installed base with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $8.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year, with a June quarter record in Greater China and strong performance in several emerging markets. We continue to see Apple Watch expand its reach with about 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And this is combined with very high levels of customer satisfaction, which was recently reported at 98% in the United States. Moving on to Services. We reached a new all-time revenue record of $21.2 billion with year-over-year growth accelerating sequentially to 8% and up double digits in constant currency. In addition to the all-time records Tim mentioned earlier, we also set June quarter records for advertising, App Store and Music. We are very pleased with our performance in Services, which is a direct reflection of our ecosystem's strength. First, our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. Second, we see increased customer engagement with our services. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each reaching a new all-time high. Third, our paid subscriptions showed strong growth. This past quarter, we reached an important milestone and passed 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 150 million during the last 12 months and nearly double the number of paid subscriptions we had only 3 years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current services. From 20 new games on Apple Arcade, to brand-new content on Apple TV+, to the launch of our high-yield savings account with Apple Card, our customers are loving these enhanced offerings. Turning to the enterprise market. Our customers are leveraging Apple products every day to help improve productivity and attract talent. Blackstone, a global investment management firm, is expanding its Apple footprint from their corporate iPhone fleet to now offering the MacBook Air powered by M2 to all of their corporate employees and portfolio companies. Gilead, a leading biopharmaceutical company, has deployed thousands of iPads globally to their sales team. Over the last 6 months, they have also doubled their Mac user base by making MacBook Air available to more employees with a focus on user experience and strong security. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $166 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $7.5 billion in maturing debt while issuing $5.2 billion of new debt and increasing commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $109 billion. As a result, net cash was $57 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $24 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $18 billion through open market repurchases of 103 million Apple shares. We continue to believe there is great value in our stock and maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Saori referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our September quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the June quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of over 2 percentage points. We expect iPhone and Services year-over-year performance to accelerate from the June quarter. Also, we expect the revenue for both Mac and iPad to decline by double digits year-over-year due to difficult compares, particularly on the Mac. For both products, we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter a year ago and were able to fulfill significant pent-up demand in the year ago September quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 44% and 45%. We expect OpEx to be between $13.5 billion and $13.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on August 17, 2023, to shareholders of record as of August 14, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.\\nSaori Casey: Thank you, Luca. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We will go ahead and take our first question from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse.\\nShannon Cross: Tim, you mentioned -- and actually, Luca, too, you mentioned an uneven macro environment during the quarter several times on the call. I'm wondering if you can talk on a geographic basis about some of the trends you're seeing in iPhone. I'm specifically wondering how demand is trending within...\\nLuca Maestri: Sure. Shannon, I'll answer it. I didn't get the end of your question.\\nOperator: I think she has dropped.\\nLuca Maestri: Okay. Well, let me answer the question for the part that I could follow. So on a geographic basis, we've had great performance for iPhone in emerging markets. We set June quarter records in many of the emerging markets. We grew in total double digits. And the performance was strong across the board in emerging markets from China, where our performance improved from minus 3% to plus 8% in the June quarter and we grew double digits in constant currency, to many other areas around the world from India, where, again, we set a June quarter record with very strong performance there, Indonesia, Southeast Asia, in general, Latin America, Middle East. And so it's been really good there. We -- also, as you can see from our geographic segments, we had a slight acceleration of performance in the Americas, primarily in the United States, but we declined there because the smartphone market has been in a decline for the last couple of quarters in the United States.\\nShannon Cross: Sorry about that. I'm not sure why I cut off. In terms of gross margin, you were at the high end of the range [Technical Difficulty] and you guided to 45% at the high end, which is, I think, higher than I remember in 20 years of covering you. So how should we think about puts and takes of gross margin? And it seems like there's like a perfect storm of good things. So I just -- maybe if you can talk about how you're thinking about it more holistically.\\nLuca Maestri: I think you remember correctly, Shannon, because the 44.5% for the June quarter is an all-time record for us in June. We were up 20 basis points sequentially. It was driven by cost savings and a mix shift towards Services, which obviously helps company gross margins, partially offset by the seasonal loss of leverage. We have a commodity environment that is favorable to us. Our product mix is quite strong at this point. And so with the exception of foreign exchange, which continues to be a drag, and it was a significant drag on a year-over-year basis, yes, we are in a good position right now. We are in a good position for the June quarter. And as I mentioned, we expect similar level of gross margins for the same reasons, frankly, for the September quarter.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.\\nWamsi Mohan: Luca, can you just give us a little more color around the guidance? Your overall revenue performance, you called out similar. Obviously, you absorbed a higher FX impact this quarter versus your guide. And you also noted Services acceleration. So just wondering, when you think about that comment on iPhone acceleration, is that on a reported basis? Is that constant currency basis? And is there something that's changing in terms of seasonality perhaps for you that is causing not as much step-up in product revenue as typical on a sequential basis? And I have a follow-up.\\nLuca Maestri: Yes. So all our comments are in reported currency, not in constant currency in relation to the outlook. And we said acceleration sequentially for iPhone and for Services. But we're also pointing out -- and this is where I think, Wamsi, you're referring to some seasonality issues. We also said that for Mac and iPad, we expect to decline double digits. And the reason for that is that we have a very difficult compare versus last year. You remember that a year ago, in the June quarter, we had factory shutdowns for both Mac and iPad. And so we were able to fill the pent-up demand from those shutdowns during the September quarter. So an unusual level of activity that we had a year ago. And so now, obviously, the compare is difficult. So we expect both iPad and Mac to be down double digits, which offset the acceleration that I mentioned for iPhone and Services.\\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. And Tim, I was wondering if you could update us on what percent of iPhones are sold on some type of installment basis now versus full upfront payment on a global basis. And maybe some thoughts on if you expect similar promotional activity from carriers, especially in the U.S., that seem to be grappling with a lot of cash flow issues this particular year.\\nLuca Maestri: Wamsi, I'll take it. We've done a really good job over the last few years with affordability programs around the world directly in our direct channel and with our partners around the world. The majority of iPhones, at this point, are sold using some kind of a program, trade-ins, installments, some kind of financing. And that percentage, which again, it's well over 50%, is very similar across developed and emerging markets. We want to do more of that because we think it really helps reduce the affordability threshold for our products. And we think it is also one of the reasons why our product mix has been very strong during the last couple of cycles. So we will continue to push on that front.\\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS.\\nDavid Vogt: I just wanted to follow up on 2 points that both you, Tim, and Luca made about growth and maybe commodities. So just to be clear, I know you're talking about an acceleration in iPhone, but the comp is about 2 points easier from FX. So I just want to understand, is that on a like-for-like basis, excluding the currency improvement of about 2 points from the June quarter to the September quarter? And from a commodity perspective, I know last quarter, you talked about buying a lot of inventory at favorable prices, which was an incredibly smart strategy. Where do you sit today? And what's sort of the timing or the duration of that commodity sort of backlog that you have as we think about next quarter and the subsequent quarters? How far does that get you out into the future from this favorable cost dynamic?\\nLuca Maestri: Let me start again. I just want to be clear about the guidance, the outlook guidance that we provided. We're referring entirely to reported numbers. So they take into account the fact that we have a slight improvement in foreign exchange. So when I talk about similar performance, I refer to reported performance in the June quarter and then the reported performance in the September quarter. And again, we expect, on a reported basis, our iPhone performance to accelerate, our Services performance to accelerate, and iPad and Mac to decline double digits. On the commodity front, as I mentioned, the environment is favorable. We always make sure that we take advantage of the opportunities that are available in the market, and we will continue to do that going forward.\\nDavid Vogt: Luca, any sense of how long that gives you a run rate today based on what you currently have? Can you give us a sense for at least the short-term tailwind?\\nLuca Maestri: I don't want to speculate past the September quarter because that's the horizon where we provide guidance. And I've said that the guidance for September is 44% to 45%, which you know is historically very high. And so obviously, that reflects a favorable environment for us.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\\nErik Woodring: I have 2 as well. Maybe if we just start kind of big picture, Tim or Luca. I was wondering if you could just kind of share some incremental color on how you think the consumer is behaving today versus 90 days ago and maybe how that differs by region. Meaning, are there any signs that consumer is incrementally more willing to spend on things like consumer electronics? Or is there still relative caution in the market? Are there any regions where you're seeing more strength in the consumer? And how sustainable do you think some of that strength or weakness could be based on some of the KPIs you track? And then I have a follow-up.\\nTim Cook: Yes. David, it's Tim. If you sort of step around the world, we did exceptionally well in emerging markets last quarter and even better on a constant currency basis. And so emerging markets were -- was a strength. If you look at China, in China, we went from a negative 3% in Q2 to a plus 8% in Q3. And so in China, we had an acceleration. If you look at the U.S., which is in the -- obviously in the Americas segment, it is the vast majority of what's in there, there was also a slight acceleration sequentially, although the Americas is still declining somewhat year-over-year, as you can see on the data sheet. The primary reason for that is that it's a challenging smartphone market in the U.S. currently. And then in Europe, Europe saw a record quarter and -- for the June quarter, a record. And so some really good signs in most places in the world.\\nErik Woodring: Awesome. And then maybe, Luca, a question for you. I think it's been about 3 quarters now where we've seen OpEx either grow below historical seasonality or come in below your expectations. I think this is the first time we've seen R&D grow less than 10% year-over-year since fiscal 2Q 2007. So can you maybe just talk about some of the cost actions you're taking? And as you look forward, what are the indicators that you're really evaluating that would give you greater confidence in perhaps returning back to a more seasonal cadence of OpEx spending? Or is this just a new normal that we should be expecting? That's it for me.\\nLuca Maestri: Obviously, we look at the environment, and we know that this has been an uncertain period for the last few quarters. And so we decided to be deliberate in what we do in terms of controlling our spend, and there's many areas across the company that we're working on and we've been quite effective at slowing down the spend. We slowed down also the hiring within the company in several areas. And we're very pleased with our ability to decelerate some of the expense growth taking into account the overall macro situation. We will continue to manage deliberately. You can see that we continue to grow our R&D costs faster than the rest of the company. SG&A is actually growing at a much slower pace because obviously, our focus continues to be in innovation and product development, and we'll continue to do that.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.\\nMichael Ng: I just have 2 questions as well. First, it was encouraging to see the Services outperformance in the quarter, up double digits on an FX-neutral basis, and more Services acceleration next quarter on a reported basis. I was just wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about key underlying drivers for the confidence in the Services acceleration next quarter, understanding that FX a little bit. But anything to call out as it relates to things in Apple Search Ads that's helping. You're obviously making a lot of investments in Apple TV+ between MLS and the Canal+ deal. So any thoughts there would be great.\\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Michael, you're correct. I mean clearly, we've seen an improvement in the June quarter, and we expect further improvement in the September quarter. In June, the performance was across the board. Tim and I mentioned we set records really across the board. We had all-time records in cloud, in video, in AppleCare, in payments and June quarter records in App Store, advertising and Music. So we saw improvement in all our Services categories. We think the situation will continue to improve as we go through September. And that's very positive because not only good for the financial results, but obviously, it shows a high level of engagement of our customers in the ecosystem, which is very important for us. And it's really the sum of all the things that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. It goes from the fact that our installed base continues to grow, so we've got a larger pool of customers, to the fact that our customers are more engaged as we have more transacting accounts and paid accounts on the ecosystem. And the subscriptions business is very healthy with growth of 150 million paid subscriptions just in the last 12 months. It's almost double to what we had 3 years ago. And of course, we are providing more and more content to our users. And so the combination of all these things gives us good confidence for September.\\nMichael Ng: Great. And just as a related follow-up, it's about the hardware installed base and Services ARPU. I was curious when you talked about the Services strength, you talked about the 2 billion-plus installed base. When you think about the opportunity to increase the Services ARPU, do you really think about it internally on a per-active-iPhone user basis or on a per-device basis? Said differently, I'm just curious where you think about -- whether you think there's an incremental opportunity for those users that have multiple devices. Do you really see a big Services ARPU uplift in that respect?\\nLuca Maestri: Well, we know that customers that own more than one device are typically more engaged in our ecosystem. And so obviously, they tend to also spend more on the Services front. I would say the biggest opportunity is that we know that there's a lot of customers that we have that are very familiar with our ecosystem. They are engaged in the ecosystem. But still today, they're using only the portion of the ecosystem that is free. And so we think that by offering better content and more content over time, we're going to be able to attract more of them as paid customers.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\\nAmit Daryanani: I have 2 as well. I guess, Luca, maybe if you can talk about Wearables a bit. The growth over there, I think, in constant currency was fairly impressive at plus 6%. Can you just touch on maybe what's driving that? And then how do we think about the Wearables segment heading into the September quarter? I know you talked about a bunch of other ones, but how do we think about Wearables into September as well?\\nLuca Maestri: Sorry, Amit, I didn't get the -- what are you referring to?\\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Sorry. I was hoping you could talk a bit about the Wearables segment because the growth over there was fairly impressive. And then how do you think about it into September as well?\\nLuca Maestri: Yes. On the Wearables front, we had really good performance in Greater China. And that's, again, very important for us. It was a June quarter record for Greater China. Very important for us because, again, it shows that the engagement with the ecosystem in a market that is so important for us like China continues to grow. It means that there's more and more customers that are owning more than the iPhone. Also, we continue to grow the installed base of the category very quickly because, as I mentioned, 2/3 of every buyer of Apple Watch during the course of the June quarter was new to the product. And so that is all additive to the installed base. So it's just great to see that the AirPods continue to be a great success in the marketplace for us. And so things are moving in the right direction there. It's become a very large business for us in Wearables, Home and Accessories. The last 12 months, we've done $40 billion of business, which is nearly the size of a Fortune 100 company. So it's become very important, and it's allowed us to diversify both our revenues and our earnings.\\nAmit Daryanani: That's really helpful. And then if I could just follow up, the Europe growth, the growth in Europe at up 5% is totally notable as well. I think you have a few emerging markets that you put in Europe as well. But I would love to understand what's happening in Europe and if there's a way to think about sort of Western Europe or developed world versus emerging markets over there.\\nLuca Maestri: Yes. It's been very good, primarily on the emerging market side of Europe. We include India and the Middle East and Central and Eastern Europe into the Europe segment. But as we mentioned at the beginning of the call, we had a number of markets that did very well, like France, like Italy, the Netherlands, Austria. So it was a good quarter for Europe.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.\\nHarsh Kumar: I have one for Luca and then later on one for Tim. So Luca, for some time now, for many quarters, you've had a currency headwind or foreign exchange currency headwind. It's conceivable that as rates start to come down, hopefully next year that the dollar weakens. Could you take us through the mechanism of how that will work on your revenues and for your costs?\\nLuca Maestri: So we tend -- we try to hedge our foreign exchange exposures because we think it's the right approach for the company in terms of minimizing the volatility that necessarily happens from the movements of currencies. We cannot effectively hedge every single exposure around the world because in some cases, it is not possible. In other cases, it is prohibitively expensive. But we tend to cover all the major currency payers that we have. About 60% of our business is outside the United States. So it's a very, very large and, I would say, very effective hedging program. And so we set up these hedges, and they tend to roll over very regularly. And then we replace them with new hedges at the new spot rate. So the impact that we're going to have on revenue and cost will depend on where the spot rates are at different points in time. And therefore, because of the way the program works, tends to be a bit of a lag in both directions as the foreign exchange moves over time.\\nHarsh Kumar: Understood. Very helpful. And for Tim, Tim, historically, for the last many years, carriers in at least the U.S., which I think is your largest market for iPhone, have had programs to help folks upgrade, whether they give a cash rebate or you bring in your old phone, something like that. I was curious, as you get into your peak December quarter, if you're aware of these programs are in place. And the reason why I'm asking is I think earlier, you mentioned that more than 50% of your phones are sold through some kind of program. I assume the number is even higher in the U.S.\\nTim Cook: I don't want to get into revealing specifics in the different carriers. But generally speaking, I would think that it would be quite easy to find a promotion on a phone, provided you're hooking up to a service and either switching services, carriers or upgrading your phone at the same carrier. I think both of those cases today that you can find promotions out there, and I would expect that you'd be able to do that in the December time frame as well.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\\nAaron Rakers: I have two as well. So first of all, I just want to kind of ask Tim. Strategically, as we think about the Services growth and kind of the content expansion behind that, I'm curious if you could help us maybe appreciate what you've seen from a sporting perspective in terms of the engagement with MLS, the engagement with Major League Baseball, and how strategically you're thinking about expansion in sports as a key driver of Services growth going forward.\\nTim Cook: We're focused on original content, as you know, with TV+. And so we're all about giving great storytellers the venue to tell great stories and hopefully get us all to think a little deeper. And sport is a part of that because sport is the ultimate original story. And for MLS, we're -- we could not be happier with how the partnership is going. It's clearly in the early days, but we are beating our expectation in terms of subscribers, and the fact that Messi went to Inter Miami helped us out there a bit. And so we're very excited about it.\\nAaron Rakers: Yes. And as a quick follow-up, I'm just curious, an update on -- you mentioned in your prepared remarks the continued growth that you've seen in India. I'm curious how we think about that market opportunity looking forward. Is there anything that you see evolving that could accelerate the opportunity for iPhone in that large mobile market?\\nTim Cook: We did hit a June quarter revenue record in India, and we grew strong double digits. We also opened our first 2 retail stores during the quarter. And it's -- of course, it's early going currently, but they're currently beating our expectation in terms of how they're doing. We continue to work on building out the channel and putting more investment in our direct-to-consumer offers as well. And so I think if you look at it, it's the second largest smartphone market in the world. And it's -- so we ought to be doing really well there. And where I'm really pleased with our growth there, we're still -- we still have a very, very modest and low share in the smartphone market. And so I think that it's a huge opportunity for us. And we're putting the -- all of our energies in making that occur.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.\\nSidney Ho: Your -- I just wanted to ask about the AI side of things. Your strategy on AI seems quite different than many of your peers, at least you don't talk too much about that, how much you invest in it. Maybe you can elaborate a little bit on that. But related to that, how do you see your investment in this area turning into financial performance in the future? Is it mainly through faster upgrade cycle, maybe higher ASP? Or are you thinking about maybe additional services that you can capitalize on that? And then I have a follow-up.\\nTim Cook: If you take a step back, we view AI and machine learning as core fundamental technologies that are integral to virtually every product that we build. And so if you think about WWDC in June, we announced some features that will be coming in iOS 17 this fall, like Personal Voice and Live Voicemail. Previously, we had announced lifesaving features like fall detection and crash detection and ECG. None of these features that I just mentioned and many, many more would be possible without AI and machine learning. And so it's absolutely critical to us. And of course, we've been doing research across a wide range of AI technologies, including generative AI for years. We're going to continue investing and innovating and responsibly advancing our products with these technologies with the goal of enriching people's lives. And so that's what it's all about for us. And as you know, we tend to announce things as they come to market, and that's our MO, and I'd like to stick to that.\\nSidney Ho: Okay. That's fair. Maybe as a follow-up is related to -- you talked about WWDC, where you actually introduced Vision Pro there. Clearly, a very big announcement there. How should we think about the revenue ramp related to the Vision Pro? Is there any catalysts that we should be thinking about that will drive an inflection of that product?\\nTim Cook: Yes. There's enormous excitement around the Vision Pro. We're excited internally. Everybody that's been through the demos are blown away, whether you're talking about press or analysts or developers. We are now shipping units to the developer community for them to begin working on their apps. And we're looking forward to shipping early next year. And so we could not be more excited with that. I'm using the product daily. And so we're not going to forecast revenues and so forth on the call today, but we're very excited about it.\\nOperator: We will take our last question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.\\nKrish Sankar: I have two of them as well. Number one, on iPhone, Tim, you mentioned about the record number of switchers in the quarter. I'm kind of curious how to think about, given the weak macro and consumer spending, how is the replacement cycle for iPhone? Is it similar, longer, shorter versus prior years? And can you talk a little bit about the demand linearity of iPhone during the June quarter? And then I have a follow-up.\\nTim Cook: Switchers were a very key part of our iPhone results for the quarter. We did set a record. We set a record in Greater China, in particular, and it was at the heart of our results there. And we continue to try to convince more and more people to switch because of our -- the experience and the ecosystem and -- that we can offer them. And so I think switching is a huge opportunity for us. In terms of the upgrade cycle and so forth, it's very difficult to estimate real time what is going on with the upgrade cycle. I would say, if you think about the iPhone results year-over-year, you have to think about the SE announcement in the year ago quarter, the iPhone SE announcement in the year ago quarter. And so that provides a bit of a headwind on the comp. But as Luca said, as he talked about how we're viewing Q4, the September quarter, we see iPhone accelerating in Q4.\\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful, Tim. And then my final question is on your retail stores, you obviously have a very large retail footprint and many of your stores seem to have been open for over a year now. How is the foot traffic there? And how do you think about sales or the retail trends in the June quarter and implications for the back half of this year on a seasonality basis?\\nTim Cook: I'm sorry, are you talking about our retail stores?\\nKrish Sankar: Yes, yes, your retail stores.\\nTim Cook: Yes. The -- if you look at retail, it's a key part of our go-to-market approach, and it will be so key and such a competitive advantage with Vision Pro. It will give us the opportunity to launch a new product and demo to many people in the stores. And so it has many advantages in it. And we continue to roll out more stores. As you know, we just opened 2 in India last quarter. We're -- there's still a lot of countries out there that don't have Apple stores that we would like to go into. And so we continue to see it as a key part of how we go to market and love the experience that we can provide customers there.\\nSaori Casey: A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts, at a webcast of apple.com/investor and via telephone.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\\nTim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we're reporting revenue of $94.8 billion for the March quarter, which was better than our expectations. We set an all-time record for Services and a March quarter record for iPhone. We were particularly pleased with the performance we saw in emerging markets and achieved all-time records in Mexico, Indonesia, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE, as well as a number of March quarter records, including in Brazil, Malaysia and India. This result is a testament, first and foremost to our teams around the world who are engaged every day in the work of bringing new innovations to life. It speaks to the incredible power of Apple products and services to enrich people's lives in indispensable ways. And whether it's in the design lab in Cupertino, or in one of the brand new retail stores in India, I am constantly inspired by the way our people come together to make a real difference in the world. During the March quarter, we continued to face foreign exchange headwinds, which had an impact of more than 500 basis points, as well as ongoing challenges related to the macroeconomic environment. Revenue was down 3% year-over-year as a result, while on a constant currency basis, we grew in total and in the vast majority of the markets we tried. Despite these challenges, we continue to manage for the long term and to push the limits of what's possible, always on behalf of the customers who depend on our products whether it's students exploring new frontiers, developers dreaming up their next big idea, or artists taking their creativity to a whole new level. Let me share how these results showed up across our lineup of products and services. Let's start with iPhone, which set a new March quarter record with revenue of $51.3 billion. The iPhone 14 and 14 plus continue to delight users with their long lasting battery and advanced camera. And our pro users continue to rave about the most powerful camera system ever in an iPhone. This March, we were excited to expand emergency SOS via satellite to six new countries, bringing this important safety feature to even more users. We now offer this vital service in 12 countries, and I'm grateful for every note I've received from around the world about the life saving impact of our safety features. Now let's turn to Mac, which recorded $7.2 billion in revenue for the March quarter in line with our expectations. As we noted during our last call, Mac faced a very difficult compare because of the incredibly successful rollout of our M1 chip throughout the Mac lineup last year. And like our other product lines, Mac is facing some macroeconomic and foreign exchange headwinds as well. That said, the advancements we've made in power efficient performance continue to amaze our users. Our M2 Mac Mini customers are raving about the pro level powerhouse packed into an ultra-compact design, and users are marveling at the power and speed at the heart of every M2 powered MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which allowed them to sustain even the most demanding workloads. iPad revenue was $6.7 billion, which was also in line with our expectations. Similar to Mac, iPad revenue performance was impacted by macroeconomic challenges, foreign exchange headwinds, and a difficult compare with last year when we launched the M1 powered iPad Air. iPad's versatility continues to be its greatest strength as we're helping students learn on the same family of devices artists use to create their next masterpiece. Across wearables, home and accessories, revenue was $8.8 billion. With its exceptional range of game changing health and safety features, Apple Watch becomes more and more indispensable every day. Apple Watch Ultra is attracting adventures, athletes and everyday users with its breakthrough features built for endurance and exploration. And with summer travel season soon heating up, there's no better companion in the air or on the road than AirPods, the best and most popular headphones in the world. Meanwhile, Services set an all-time record with $20.9 billion in revenue for the March quarter. We achieved all time revenue records across App Store, Apple Music, iCloud and payment services. And now, with more than 975 million paid subscriptions, we're reaching even more people with our lineup of services. Apple TV Plus continues to draw praise from customers and reviewers alike. During the past quarter, fans tuned in to incredible new series like Shrinking and The Big Door Prize and got to welcome Ted Lasso back into their homes for a third season. Movies like Tetris are captivating viewers with many more to come, including Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon later this year. Three years since its launch, Apple TV Plus programming has been celebrated across the globe, with over 1,450 nominations and more than 350 wins. Recently, we were thrilled to cheer on The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse, which won an Academy Award for best Animated Short Film. The first season of our historic tenure partnership with Major League Soccer is well underway with MLS season pass, we've created the ultimate destination for soccer fans, offering subscribers the ability to watch every match with no blackouts. And with baseball season in full swing, Apple TV Plus subscribers can watch their favorite teams with the return of Friday night baseball. This quarter, we launched Apple Music Classical, a standalone app that gives something special to classical music lovers. Apple Music Classical packs the largest library of classical music on Earth into a thoughtful and intuitive design that strikes all the right notes. Whether you're listening with AirPods or HomePod, the premium sound experience of Apple Music Classical will leave you with a feeling of being front row at the symphony just behind the conductor. In March, we also launched Apple Pay Later designed with users privacy and financial health in mind. Apple Pay Later allows users to split purchases into multiple payments with no interest or fees. And last month, we introduced Apple Card Savings Accounts to give users even more value out of their daily cash Apple Card Benefit. At Apple, our customers are at the center of everything we do. Nowhere is that more evident than retail, where our teams are dedicated to sharing the best of Apple with our customers. And we're constantly innovating to deliver exceptional experiences and meet our customers where they are. In the US, we launch Shop with a specialist over video, a new way for customers to learn about iPhone and find the one that's just right for them. And as I noted earlier, in a milestone for Apple, we just opened our first two Apple stores in India, in Mumbai and Delhi. I was there to see it for myself, and I couldn't have been more delighted by the excitement and enthusiasm of the customers, developers, creators and team members I got to spend time with. I've had the chance to connect with customers and teams all around the world in recent months, so many people shared with me that they were fans of Apple, not just because of the innovations we create, but because of the values that guide us, and that means a great deal to us. We're constantly striving to make a positive difference in people's lives and be a force for progress. We're investing in education to give students the skills they need to shape the future. We're helping to create pathways of opportunity for communities of color through our Racial Equity and justice initiative. And every day we're building an even more inclusive and diverse Apple rooted in our culture of belonging. To better understand how our work intersects with our values, look no further than what we're doing for the environment. We just celebrated Earth Day in April, and during that month, Apple announced that its global manufacturing partners now support over 13 gigawatts of renewable energy, a nearly 30% increase in just the last year. This translates to 17.4 million metric tons of avoided carbon emissions, the equivalent of removing nearly 3.8 million cars from the road. We're all investing up to an additional $200 million in our Restore Fund, which is designed to support innovative, scalable, nature based carbon removal projects, with the goal of removing 1 million metric tons of carbon every year. These are just the latest steps on our journey toward our 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across our supply chain and lifecycle of our devices. At the same time, we're advancing renewable energy across our supply chain, we're also sourcing more recycled materials in our products. Last month, we announced our plans to have all Apple design batteries include 100% certified recycled cobalt by 2025, and we remain committed to one day using only recycled and renewable materials in our products. We have a deep sense of mission here at Apple. We believe in the power of innovation to build a better world. We are determined to do our best work on behalf of our customers and to give them the tools that can enrich lives. So we will manage for the long term, just as we always have, with our eyes to the horizon, with limitless creativity, and with a deep belief that we can achieve anything we put our minds to. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $94.8 billion, down 3% from last year and better than our expectations. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of over five percentage points on our results, in line with what we had expected. On a constant currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total and in the majority of the markets we track. In addition to the records in emerging markets that Tim mentioned, we also set March quarter records in Australia, Canada, Spain and Switzerland, among others. Products revenue was $73.9 billion, down 5% from last year, due to challenging compares on Mac and iPad. iPhone, however, reached a March quarter revenue record thanks to very strong performance in emerging markets from South Asia and India to Latin America and the Middle East. During the quarter, our installed base of active devices continued to grow at a nice pace thanks to extremely high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, and reached an all-time high for all major product categories and geographic segments. Our Services set an all-time revenue record of $20.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year, on top of growing 17% in the March quarter a year ago. We reached an all-time services revenue record in Greater China and March quarter records in Americas, Europe and Rest of Asia Pacific. Company gross margin was 44.3%, up 130 basis points from last quarter, driven by cost savings and favorable mix shift towards services partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 36.7%, decreasing 30 basis points sequentially due to seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 71%, up 20 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses of $13.7 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and continued to decelerate from the December quarter. We are closely managing our spend, but remain focused on long term growth with continued investment in innovation and product development. Net income was $24.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share were a $1.52, unchanged versus last year, and we generated very strong operating cash flow of $28.6 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue set a March quarter record of $51.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year despite significant foreign exchange headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. We set March quarter records in several developed and emerging markets with India, Indonesia, Turkey and the UAE doubling on a year-over-year basis. Our active installed base of iPhone grew to a new all-time high and was up in all our geographic segments. We are very pleased by the results of the latest survey of US Consumers from 451 Research, which measured customer satisfaction at 99% for the iPhone 14 family. Mac revenue was $7.2 billion, down 31% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. These results were driven by the challenging macroeconomic environment coupled with a difficult compare against last year's launch of the completely reimagined M1 MacBook Pros. Despite this, the installed base of active Macs reached an all-time high across all geographic segments and we continue to see strong upgraded activity to Apple silicon. Also, the latest survey of US Consumers from 451 Research reported customer satisfaction at 96% for Mac. iPad generated $6.7 billion in revenue, down 13% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. This performance was due to two key factors, a tough compare against the launch of iPad Air powered by the M1 chip in the year ago quarter and headwinds from the macroeconomic environment. The iPad installed base reached a new all-time high in all geographic segments thanks to exceptional customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, home and accessories revenue was $8.8 billion, down 1% year-over-year as the category experienced the impact from the macroeconomic environment. However, we did set March quarter records both in the US and in Greater China. We continue to see strength in our Watch installed base, which set a new all-time record, thanks to very high customer loyalty and new two rates, nearly two thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. Moving to Services, we reached a new all-time revenue record of $20.9 billion. And in addition to the all-time records Tim mentioned earlier, we set March quarter records for advertising Apple Care and Video. Despite these records, as we saw in recent quarters, certain services offerings such as digital advertising and mobile gaming continue to be affected by the current macroeconomic environment. Stepping back, however, the continued growth in Services is the reflection of our ecosystem strength and the positive momentum we are seeing across several key metrics. First, our growing installed base of over 2 billion active devices represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem. We continue to grow across every major product category and geographic segment, thanks to very high levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction. Second, we saw increased customer engagement with our services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each setting a new all-time record. Third, paid subscriptions showed strong growth. We now have more than $975 million paid subscriptions across the Services on our platform, up 150 million during the last 12 months and nearly double the number of paid subscriptions we had only three years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current services offerings from new content on Apple TV Plus to great new features available in Apple Pay and Apple Music, which we believe our customers will love. Turning to the enterprise market, we see business customers continuing to invest in the Apple platform to drive higher employee productivity and satisfaction. In Brazil, Boticario Group, the world's largest cosmetics franchiser, originally starting with iPhone, 12 employees manage operations across a network of retail stores, franchisees and resellers. As it continues to digitize its business, Boticario has chosen to move all software development in house and adopted Mac as the standard device for all of their developer teams across the world. In small business, we see an increasing number of customers relying on Apple hardware, software and services to power their businesses forward, from accepting payments on iPhone, to tracking inventory on Mac or iPad, to managing employee devices with Apple Business Essentials. As we celebrate National Small Business week here in the US, we are proud to continue supporting the small business community. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $166 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by about $300 million, leaving us with total debt of $110 billion. As a result, net cash was $57 billion at the end of the quarter. During the March quarter, we returned over $23 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19.1 billion through open market repurchases of $129 million Apple shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today our Board has authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral over time. We're also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.24 a share, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our June quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the March quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind and we expect a negative year-over-year impact of nearly four percentage points. For Services, we expect our June quarter year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to the March quarter, while continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. We expect gross margin to be between 44% and 44.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $13.6 billion and $13.8 billion. We expect OINE to be around negative $250 million excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally reflecting the dividend increase I mentioned earlier, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on May 18, 2023, to shareholders of record as on May 15, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley.\\nErik Woodring: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Tim, maybe if we start with you. If we go back to the December quarter and the shutdowns, the production shutdowns around the time I think the question a lot of us were asking was how should we think about the deferral of demand versus destruction of demand? March quarter was quite strong 2% year-over-year iPhone growth. And so as we sit here in May, how have you seen that customers that weren't able to purchase during the December quarter behave? Meaning, are you seeing that they deferred purchases to March and June? Could they be deferring purchases to later and hopes of buying a new iPhone? Just how should maybe we think about the cadence of that and then I have a follow up. Thanks.\\nTim Cook: Yes. Hi, Erik. It's hard to quantify this, but we do believe we did recapture some amount of sales in the March quarter as we did see the iPhone performance accelerate relative to the December quarter. The production levels for the whole quarter were where we wanted them to be. So supply was not an issue during Q2.\\nErik Woodring: Okay, perfect. Thank you for that color. And then, Tim, maybe to follow up, it's been three or four quarters now that you've mentioned emerging markets like India and others. And I imagine, having just opened two new stores in the country, clearly an important market for you. So maybe can you just talk about why you see India as such an important market and others, how you think about monetization trends in the country and specifically what you have to do within the country to really ensure that India becomes maybe a more material mix of your business? And that's it for me. Thanks so much.\\nTim Cook: Yes, sure. Looking at the business in India, we did set a quarterly record, grew very strong, double digits year-over-year. So it was quite a good quarter for us, taking a step back, India is an incredibly exciting market. It's a major focus for us. I was just there, and the Dynamism in the market, the vibrancy is unbelievable. Over time, we've been expanding our operations there to serve more customers, and three years ago, we launched the Apple Store online, and then, as you just mentioned, we launched two stores just a few weeks ago, and they're off to a great start, one in Mumbai and one in Delhi. We've got a number of channel partners in the country as well that we're partnering with, and we're very happy with how that's going overall. Overall, I couldn't be more delighted and excited by the enthusiasm I'm seeing for the brand there. There are a lot of people coming into the middle class, and I really feel that India is at a tipping point, and it's great to be there. On other emerging markets, we had a stellar quarter in emerging markets overall, as I had mentioned, with records set in a number of different places, including Indonesia and Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, UAE, and then quarterly records in Brazil, India and Malaysia. And so it was a great quarter for emerging markets in general, despite the headwinds of the currency that Luca mentioned. And so we're putting efforts in a number of these markets and really see, particularly given our low share and the dynamics of the demographics, et cetera, a great opportunity for us in those markets.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Ng of Goldman Sachs.\\nMike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. It was encouraging to hear about the record installed base across iPhone and across all devices. It's been, I think, double digit growth over the last few years across the active devices. I was just wondering, is that a good way to think about the installed base growth going forward? And then for the iPhone installed base specifically, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit of texture around how you think about the growth there, whether regionally or by first, smartphones versus switchers. And then I have a quick follow up.\\nTim Cook: Yes. If you look at the installed base of active devices now, overall it's more than $2 billion. As you know, we announced in January that we surpassed that. And this quarter, our Q2 rather we set new records across each of the geographic segments and each of the major product categories. And that's despite declines in current quarter sales, in particular in Mac and iPad. This is a huge asset for us, and it's a testament to the overall customer satisfaction and engagement and loyalty of our customers. And so we view this as a major asset for us. The iPhone base is well over a $1 billion active devices. We see this as upgrade rates, and these sorts of things may change quarter-to-quarter depending upon macroeconomic. But if you back up and look at the installed base, we feel great about the size of it and the rate that it's growing.\\nMike Ng: Great. Excellent. And then it was also encouraging to see the number of devices per iPhone user continue to grow. I was just wondering if you could talk about the opportunity to continue to increase that number of Apple devices per iPhone user and if you have any color around how the monetization per user may differ from those, for lack of better words, super users versus those that may not be as deep into the ecosystem. Thanks.\\nTim Cook: We try really hard to design our products in such a way that they work seamlessly together, and so whether that's the watch or the Mac, so that you can start working on one device and finish it on the other. And so there are a good deal of people out there that have multiple Apple devices, and I think this is a testament to the customer satisfaction and loyalty that we've been able to get from the incredible design that our engineering teams do on our products.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse.\\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. Thank you for taking my question. Tim, can you talk a bit about AI? It's obviously more than the topic of the day. It seems like the topic of the year. Just how you think about it through your products and services. I know you use it in different ways, but also if you can just give us any thoughts you have on generative AI and I don't know where you see it going, not sure what you want to say on it, but I'm really curious for your take. Thank you.\\nTim Cook: Yes, thanks for the question, Shannon. As you know, we don't comment on product roadmaps. I do think it's very important to be deliberate and thoughtful in how you approach these things. And there's a number of issues that need to be sorted, as is being talked about in a number of different places. But the potential is certainly very interesting. And we've obviously made enormous progress integrating AI and machine learning throughout our ecosystem and we weaved it into products and features for many years as you probably know. You can see that in things like fall detection and crash detection and ECG, these things are not only great features, they're saving people's lives out there. And so it's absolutely remarkable. And so we are, we view AI as huge and we'll continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis.\\nShannon Cross: Okay. Thank you. And then can you talk a bit about your shift of manufacturing and diversification of manufacturing footprint? I'm curious. Obviously, you have a very tight network in China. So how is it going to move to some of these other regions? Are you seeing any impact from a margin perspective or just any thoughts you have on what you've seen as you started to shift more and more outside of China? Whether it's growth or it's actual production? Thank you.\\nTim Cook: Our supply chain is truly global and we're investing all over the world. We're investing in the US. We're investing in a number of other countries as well. So we make products everywhere. We'll continue to invest everywhere, and we'll continue to look for ways to optimize the supply chain based on what we learn each and every day and week and so forth, to ensure that we can deliver the best products and services for our customers. If you sort of step back and look at how we've performed over the last three years on the supply chain, despite this parade of horribles, if you will, between the pandemic and the chip shortages and macroeconomic kind of factors, the supply chain has been incredibly resilient, and we feel good about what we are and what our plans are.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.\\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Tim, you had called out on December quarter earnings that Pro models were significantly constrained. Do you see a catch up on the Pro model specifically in the March quarter? And was the mix better than typical? And do you see that mix renormalizing here in the June quarter? And maybe you can comment on the channel inventory levels as well for iPhones, and I have a follow up.\\nTim Cook: Sure. It's hard to quantify Wamsi, but we do believe we did recapture some amount of sales in the March quarter, and obviously we had to set the channel at the right levels. And we're very comfortable with the channel inventory that we have on a forward basis. So we do think there were some, but it's difficult to quantify it.\\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Tim. And Tim, as a follow up, you launched so many services around Apple Pay most recently, you mentioned Buy Now Pay Later high yield savings account. Where do you see the expansion and the payments ecosystem over time? And do you look at the payments ecosystem as a standalone revenue opportunity? Or is it more about making the devices even more inseparable from us? Thank you.\\nTim Cook: What we're trying to do with our payments work is that sort of like we've done on the watch, where we're focused on helping people live a healthier day on our financial products. We're helping people have a better financial health and so things like the Apple Card and the fact that it has no fees, like the savings account, which has, as you mentioned, it's very attractive yield. So we're trying to help our users, but these things have to stand on their own, obviously. But we're very user focused, and so we're listening to them at what things provide them pinch points and orchestrate our roadmaps around that. Buy Now Pay Later is another one that we've just gotten out of the shoot. But on the savings account specifically, we are very pleased with the initial response on it. It's been incredible.\\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt of UBS.\\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Tim, I just wanted to go back to maybe kind of dig into the restocking of inventory in the channel versus what we're hearing from a demand perspective that appears to be a little bit softer in the March quarter from some of your larger carriers. That exhibited relatively weak upgrade rates. So I just want to kind of get a sense for where you're seeing demand signals today vis-à-vis how you were thinking about it maybe a month ago or even three months ago. And is there sort of an acceleration in demand or any sort of signals that you might want to share with us at this point? And then I have a follow up.\\nTim Cook: I don't want to go into what we're seeing in Q3 other than the guidance that Luca has given. But for Q2, I think you're probably referencing primarily US carriers. And if you look at our geographic distribution of our performance, it was lower in the Americas, which is primarily predominantly the United States. And a part of that is, I believe it's macroeconomic. A part is that there was more promotional activity in the year ago quarter. And so I think that's what you're seeing there, where our results were really stellar during this quarter, was really in the emerging markets, and we couldn't be prouder of the results that we had there.\\nDavid Vogt: Great. That's helpful. And then just quickly on Services, are you seeing anything in terms of consumers behavior other than sort of the macro that you mentioned and tough comps on digital advertising and mobile gaming? Are you seeing users of all the disparate services change and what they're using and how they're using it and time spent with an Apple Service? Now that we're technically, hopefully fully past COVID, with China almost fully reopened, I'm just trying to get a sense for how user or consumer behavior has changed over the last three to six months. Thanks.\\nLuca Maestri: David, it’s Luca. As you said, of course we got the issue around the macroeconomic environment, particularly in advertising and in mobile gaming, but outside of those areas the behavior of customers continues to be pretty consistent. We are doing particularly well, obviously in some of the services that we've launched more recently, like payments where our growth rates are very strong as the adoption of Apple Pay and Apple Card and now the new services that Tim mentioned, the adoption continues to increase. Cloud is an area that continues to grow very consistently. Users want to store more photos and videos and more content on their devices and so they adopt our cloud services and in general the model in the App Store around paid subscriptions continues to grow very strongly. I mentioned we now have more than 975 million paid subscriptions on the platform and that's almost twice as much what we had only three years ago. So obviously, the growth in subscriptions is very strong.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe I can follow up on David's question here on services. And in the past, pre-pandemic the growth rate there was more about sort of mid-teens. The growth rates today, where you stand, even if I back out FX impact is more about low double digit. So one of the questions that we get often from investors and want to get your thoughts on is even as the installed base growth seems to have accelerated, are these more cyclical drivers that are depressing growth at this point from returning to that level or do you see more of a rollout on the monetization that you have need to do to get back to those growth levels. and I have a follow up, please.\\nLuca Maestri: Samik, that the areas where we are seeing the impact on the macroenvironment, as I mentioned, is digital advertising. As you know, obviously the macroenvironment is not helping on that front. And mobile gaming, where we've seen a bit of a slowdown, partly due to the macroenvironment, partly due to the fact that we had very elevated usage during the COVID years. But outside of those areas, we continue to see very healthy growth rates.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. And maybe if I can just follow up and this is more of a macro question. I don't know if Luca, you or Tim want to take this, but obviously the macro is not sort of helpful at this point. But what you're sort of implying in terms of your guide is momentum for your products remains pretty stable. You're actually guiding to a modest uptick FX for the overall business. I mean, what are you seeing in terms of customer sort of spending trends? And overall, does the consumer sort of continue to deteriorate in terms of spending patterns? And is your sort of momentum here just a function of share gains? How should we think about sort of where the consumer is versus what your products are doing independent of that?\\nLuca Maestri: Part of Samik is what Tim was talking about. We're having great momentum in emerging markets, and those are markets where our share is low, gives us a great opportunity to grow over time. It also helps us with the growth of the installed base, because you can imagine that in places where our market share is low, we tend to add a lot of switchers people that are new to the Apple ecosystem. That increases the install base. And over the longer term, it obviously improves our ability to monetize on services as well.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani of Evercore.\\nAmit Daryanani: I have to as well. I guess, first off on gross margins for the June quarter. They seem to be holding up fairly well, especially given the fact that sales are going down on a sequential basis. So, Luca, I'm wondering if you can just touch on what's driving the strength in gross margin sequentially. It's offsetting the lack of leverage, if you may. And then I also noticed that the range of your gross margin guide is 50 basis points, it's typically 100. What does that entail? What does that mean?\\nLuca Maestri: So you're right. I mean we are guiding to a fairly stable level of gross margins at a very high level. We're very happy with the gross margins that we're having this cycle. For the first time in several quarters, foreign exchange, we expect foreign exchange to be flat on a sequential basis at the gross margin level. Unfortunately, it's still a headwind at the revenue level, but at gross margin level, sequentially, we expect foreign exchange not to be a factor. And so the seasonal loss of leverage that you're referring to, we expect to be offset by cost savings. And so that should give us that level of margins. As you know, you were asking about the 50 basis points. We have guided to 50 basis points of a range before as well, this year in particular, because of the 14th week during the December quarter, we're a bit late in the calendar year, right. And so we have a bit more visibility around margins for the June quarter.\\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess, Tim, if I just go back to the India discussion a bit, perhaps you could just contrast what you're seeing in India at today versus what you saw in China maybe a decade or so ago. Is that a reasonable ramp to think India would have, or could it be different from the lessons you've seen in China?\\nTim Cook: I think each country is different and has their own journey, so I hesitate to compare too much. But what I do see in India is a lot of people entering the middle class, and I'm hopeful that we can convince some number of them to buy an iPhone and we'll see how that works out. But right now, it's working out well.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar of TD Cowen.\\nKrish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first question I had is for Tim. Tim, you're primarily been a consumer centric company, but it seems like the line is blurring with the iPhone, iPad, the hardware products being used for corporate applications. So is there a way to segment how much of your revenues today are coming from enterprise versus consumer? And does the slower corporate IT spend impact your outlook for iPhone, iPad, Mac, et cetera, and then I have a follow up.\\nTim Cook: Internally, we have our estimates for how much is enterprise versus consumer. And the enterprise business is growing. We have been focusing a lot on BYOD programs and there's more and more companies that are leaning into those and given employees the ability to select which is plays to our benefit, I believe, because I think a lot of people want to use a Mac at work or an iPad at work. And so but we're certainly primarily a consumer company in terms of our revenues, obviously.\\nKrish Sankar: Got it, Tim. Thanks for that. And then just as a follow up, obviously a lot of questions on the India retail opening. I'm just kind of curious. You also mentioned that you hope to convert a lot of folks into iPhone there. Where do you think the biggest opportunity? Is it like primarily a hardware business like the iPhone, iPad wearables, et cetera? Or do you think there is a service opportunity in India longer term too? Thank you very much.\\nTim Cook: I think there's an opportunity across the board, including in services. Obviously, the ARPUs are lower in India for whether you're talking about TV and movie streaming or music, the ARPUs are much lower than other regions. But if you look at it over a long arc of time, I think there's a good opportunity across the board.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.\\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first question is that I want to go back to kind of the geographical dynamics. I'm curious, as we all think about the reopening attributes of China, just how you would characterize the shaping of demand you saw through the course of this last quarter and kind of how you're thinking about the impact of that reopening playing out over the next couple of quarters.\\nTim Cook: If you look at China, our revenue came in at negative three for the quarter year-over-year, but we actually grew on a constant currency basis, and we also accelerate rated as compared to the December quarter, which, as you know, had 14 weeks in it and was a negative seven on a reported basis. And so we were pleased with how we did and with the acceleration that we saw with the reopening, and we'll see how we do this quarter. But if you look at the top selling smartphones in urban China, based on a survey from Kantar, we have four out of the top five. And I think in all of the third party data I've seen on the market itself, in the smartphone space, we believe we gained share during Q2. So we feel good about it. Also, China has a lot of very good metrics in terms of new buyers. For example, on the Mac, about six out of ten customers are buying the Mac for the first time. Same thing on iPad. If you look over at the watch, it's more than three out of four customers are buying the watch for the first time. And so the buyer metrics, if you will, are very, very good. And our services business hit an all-time record in China during the quarter.\\nAaron Rakers: Very helpful, Tim. As a quick follow up, I want to go back to Amit’s question on gross margin. You talked about FX, the lessening impact there. I'm just curious when you look at your gross margin, obviously got mixed attributes, kind of potentially continuing to drive that higher. But I'm curious on the current environment, how you would characterize the component pricing dynamics and what you're thinking about in this current quarter's Guidance.\\nLuca Maestri: The environment on the component side is favorable. We've seen component prices decline during the March quarter, and we expect the same during the June quarter.\\nOperator: Our next is from Sydney Ho of Deutsche Bank.\\nSydney Ho: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you can talk about the linearity of the March quarter and perhaps the first four and a half weeks of the current quarter. It looks like things are slowing down quite a bit elsewhere, but if my math is right, your fiscal third quarter guidance implied product revenue will be a little bit lower than seasonal average on a sequential basis, any color would be helpful. Thanks.\\nLuca Maestri: We said that we expect our performance during the June quarter at the revenue level to be similar to the one that we just reported for the March quarter. Keep in mind, we always have differences in the launch timing across our products, and also that especially over the last few years, we've seen a certain amount of supply disruptions. Sometimes it was COVID related, sometimes it was related to specific component shortages. Just to remind you, in the June quarter a year ago, at the full quarter impact of the launch for both of the iPhone SE and the iPad Air, which leads to a more difficult compare. So I think it's important to keep those things in mind.\\nSydney Ho: Okay, that's helpful. Maybe a quick follow up. You talk about Apple Pay Later. How has the feedback been so far? And how do you expect the adoption of that service over the next few quarters? Thank you.\\nTim Cook: The feedback for both Apple Pay Later and the savings products have both been really good. And we think both of them help customers live a better or healthier financial life. And so we're very excited about the first days of both of them.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Harsh Kumar of Piper Sandler.\\nHarsh Kumar: Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Tim, you're one of the largest chip companies. You're not a component maker. You actually use your own products. But we almost never hear in any context of you guys being a beneficiary, Apple being a beneficiary for either the Chip Act money or the R&D tax credit that's being proposed. I was just curious if you are eligible for any of those. And then I've got a follow up.\\nTim Cook: I don't see Apple participating in the Chips Act directly, but we would be a beneficiary indirectly because some of our partners would hopefully be recipients of it and therefore put in additional capacity. And so on that sort of indirect basis, we would have a benefit.\\nHarsh Kumar: Understood. And thanks for clarification. Luca, I wanted to clarify your comments about June. When you're saying June performance will be similar to March, I assume on a year-on-year basis, which would be June should be down about two something odd percent. Is that a fair way? And then my question that I wanted to ask, maybe another one for Tim was where do you think is the largest opportunity in your services offering? You're doing a great job, you just set a record. But surely there must be areas where you think you can do better.\\nLuca Maestri: Yes. So to your question around the June performance yes, on a year-over-year basis, so comparable to the March quarter on year-over-year basis.\\nTim Cook: Harsh, I think we can do better on everything. And so I wouldn't just point to one of them. If you look at the number of active devices and the growth of active devices, I think, our services are underpenetrated in a number of different ways. And so the way that I look at it is there's opportunity in many of them.\\nSuhasini Chandramouli : All right. Thank you, Harsh.

       " \"Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apple Q1 Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.  And now at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tejas Gala, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.\\nTejas Gala: Thank you. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.  Before turning the call over to Tim, I would like to remind everyone that the December quarter spanned 14 weeks, while the March quarter, as usual, has 13 weeks. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company's business and results of operations.  These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.  I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\\nTimothy Cook: Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us.  Today, we're reporting revenue of $117.2 billion for the December quarter. We set all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, Spain, Turkey and Vietnam, along with quarterly records in Brazil and India. As a result of a challenging environment, our revenue was down 5% year-over-year. But I'm proud of the way we have navigated circumstances, seen and unforeseen, over the past several years, and I remain incredibly confident in our team and our mission and in the work we do every day.  Let me discuss the 3 factors that impacted our revenue performance during the quarter. The first was foreign exchange headwinds, which had a nearly 800 basis point impact. On a constant currency basis, we grew year-over-year and would have grown in the vast majority of the markets we track.  The second factor, which we described in a November 6 update was COVID-19-related challenges, which significantly impacted the supply of iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max and lasted through most of December. Because of these constraints, we had significantly less iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max supply than we planned, causing ship times to extend far beyond what we had anticipated. As we always have every step of the way throughout the pandemic, we continued to prioritize people and worked with our suppliers to ensure the health and safety of every worker. Production is now back where we want it to be.  The third factor was a challenging macroeconomic environment as the world continues to face unprecedented circumstances, from inflation to war in Eastern Europe, to the enduring impacts of the pandemic. And we know that Apple is not immune to it. But whatever conditions we face, our approach is always the same. We are thoughtful and deliberate. We manage for the long term. We adapt quickly to circumstances outside our control while delivering with excellence in the things we can. We invest in innovation, in people and in the positive difference we can make in the world. And we do it all to provide our customers with technology that will enrich their lives and help unlock their full creative potential. It's a wonderful thing to be a part of, and it's so rewarding for all of us at Apple when we hear how much our customers are loving what we create.  Let me talk now about what we saw across our product categories. Starting with iPhone. Revenue came in at $65.8 billion for the quarter, down 8% year-over-year. However, on a constant currency basis, iPhone revenue was roughly flat. Our customers continue to rave about the astounding camera capabilities and unprecedented battery life and the groundbreaking suite of health and safety features. The iPhone 14 lineup pushes the limits of what users can do with a smartphone.  During the quarter, Mac revenue came in at $7.7 billion, which was in line with what we had expected. We had a difficult compare because this time last year, we had the extremely successful launch of the redesigned M1 MacBook Pros. We also faced a challenging macroeconomic environment and foreign exchange headwinds. We remain confident in and focused on the long-term opportunity for Mac.  Just last month, we introduced new MacBook Pro models powered by our latest developments in Apple silicon, M2 Pro and M2 Max. These chips enable unprecedented performance and do so with less energy, which is not only good for the environment but gives the newest MacBook Pro the longest battery life ever in a Mac. We also introduced the M2-powered Mac mini, which will supercharge productivity for users of all kinds and leave them stunned by just how powerful a Mac mini can be.  During the quarter, iPad revenue grew 30% to a total of $9.4 billion. The very strong growth was due in part to a favorable compare to the December quarter a year ago when we experienced significant supply constraints. Customers continue to praise our new lineup for its versatility, whether it's the new iPad Pro now powered by the M2 or the newly designed iPad 10th Generation with its stunning liquid retina display and beautiful colors.  Revenue for Wearables, Home and Accessories was $13.5 billion, which was down 8% year-over-year driven by foreign exchange headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in the category. As an example, a few weeks ago, we announced the next-generation HomePod, which is an indispensable addition to the smart home. This powerful smart speaker relies on advanced computational audio to produce an incredible listening experience. We're also helping users make their homes safer with sound recognition. This feature, arriving later this spring, allows HomePod to send a notification directly to a user's iPhone if a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm sound is identified.  We continue to hear wide praise for Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra, which has set a new standard for what's possible with a wearable. From a whole host of health and safety features to incredible new capabilities for extreme athletes, there is something for everyone in these amazing products. Customers are excited about some phenomenal new features we've made available across many of our products as well. One of the highlights is emergency SOS via satellite, which launched for iPhone 14 customers in the U.S. and Canada in November and for customers in France, Germany, Ireland and the U.K. in December. This is a feature we hope our users will never need, but it is incredibly heartening to get e-mails from people describing the life-saving impact our new safety features have had on them.  We're always looking for new ways to empower people to create and collaborate. In December, we released Freeform, a brand-new app that lets users take their ideas wherever they want, anywhere they are, all while collaborating in real time. Freeform has already received praise from reviewers for its flexibility and simplicity as it works seamlessly across iPhone, iPad and Mac.  Today, we are very excited to announce that we've achieved a truly incredible milestone. Thanks to our deep commitment to innovation, incredible customer loyalty and satisfaction and a large number of switchers, we now have more than 2 billion active devices as part of our growing installed base, double what it was just 7 years ago. This is an incredible testament to our products and services and the strength of our ecosystem.  We set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion in services, which was better than what we had expected. We achieved double-digit revenue growth from App Store subscriptions and set all-time revenue records across a number of categories, including cloud and payment services. All told, Apple now has more than 935 million paid subscriptions.  Apple has also just begun a historic 10-year partnership with Major League Soccer. Just yesterday, we launched MLS Season Pass, which will give fans in more than 100 countries access to every live MLS regular season game as well as the playoffs and MLS Cup, all with no blackouts. And while we're providing more content to sports fans than ever before, Apple TV+ continues to showcase powerful characters and moving storytelling. We were thrilled to celebrate the holidays alongside our Apple TV+ subscribers with the hit movie Spirited. And we're delighted to see how much people are enjoying new and returning series like Shrinking, Slow Horses and Truth Be Told. And we have some great upcoming movies in Sharper and Tetris, along with Emmy Award winner Ted Lasso returning this spring.  During the quarter, we made some great updates to Fitness+ as well, expanding our catalog of more than 3,500 workouts and meditations to include a new kickboxing category and a new sleep theme for meditations. Our latest artist spotlight series features the music of the incomparable Beyonce, and we're excited to take a stroll with guests appearing on our fifth season of Time to Walk. And we continue to build on our decades-long commitment to helping small businesses thrive when we announced Apple Business Connect. This new tool gives business owners even more control over how billions of people see and engage with their products and services every day. Businesses of all sizes can now customize key information for users across Apple Maps, Messages, Wallet, Siri and other apps.  Meanwhile, in retail, we celebrated 25 years of the Apple online store and also opened Apple Pacific Centre in Vancouver and Apple American Dream in New Jersey. And I'm grateful to all the teams who helped our customers throughout the busy holiday season. At Apple, we spend a lot of time focused on creating an unparalleled experience for our customers and every product and service that we offer. We're also just as dedicated to leading with our values in everything we do. As part of that work, we strengthened our deep commitment to privacy and security, giving users 3 new tools to protect their most sensitive data: iMessage contact key verification, security keys for Apple ID and advanced data protection for iCloud.  At Apple, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to leave the world better than we found it. We're also a year closer to 2030, and we were ever focused on the environmental commitments we set out for the end of the decade. As an example, the latest Mac mini and MacBook Pro models all use 100% recycled aluminum in the enclosure and recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. And in a first for HomePod, we're using 100% recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards. In honor of Black History Month, we released the Black Unity collection, including the Special Edition Apple Watch Black Unity Sport Loop, a new matching watch face and iPhone wallpaper. Through our racial, equity and justice initiative, we're expanding our support of 5 organizations focused on lifting up communities of color through technology. And we are committed as ever to building on our progress around inclusion and diversity.  During the quarter, we also announced that since the inception of our Giving program 11 years ago, we've donated more than $880 million to humanitarian efforts, disaster relief, childhood education and more. And over the last 16 years through our partnership with (RED), Apple-supported grants have helped more than 11 million people get the care and support services they need.  As we look ahead in 2023, we are excited about the year to come. At Apple, we are always looking forward, always focused on the next challenge, always determined to do great things with unmatched creativity and unrivaled innovation. And that makes me more confident about the future of Apple than I have ever been.  With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tim mentioned, revenue for the December quarter was $117.2 billion, down 5% from last year. A number of factors had a significant impact on our results. First, we faced a very difficult foreign exchange environment, which affected our performance by nearly 800 basis points. In other words, we grew revenue on a constant currency basis. And in fact, we did so in the vast majority of markets.  Second, the macroeconomic environment this past quarter was markedly more challenging than 12 months ago. Third, we experienced significant supply shortages for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max in November and through December. On the other hand, we had the positive impact of the 14th week in the quarter that Tejas just mentioned at the beginning of the call.  Products revenue was $96.4 billion, down 8% from last year due to the factors I just called out. At the same time, however, our installed base of active devices grew double digits and achieved all-time records in each geographic segment and in each major product category. We're proud to now have over 2 billion active devices in our installed base. This continued growth in the installed base is due to extremely strong levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers who are new to our products.  The installed base growth also helped our services set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion, up 6% over a year ago. We achieved this new milestone despite more than 700 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. We reached all-time services revenue records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia Pacific and a December quarter record in Greater China. We also set records in many Services categories, including all-time revenue records for cloud services, payment services and music and December quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare. Company gross margin was 43%, up 70 basis points from last quarter due to leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 37%, up 240 basis points sequentially. And Services gross margin was 70.8%, up 30 basis points sequentially, both due to the same factors that impacted total company gross margin.  Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were significantly below the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and grew at a slower pace than in the past as we took actions to respond to the current macro environment. Net income was $30 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.88, and we generated very strong operating cash flow of $34 billion.  Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $65.8 billion despite significant foreign exchange headwinds, supply constraints on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max and a challenging macroeconomic environment. In spite of these circumstances, we set all-time iPhone revenue records in Canada, Italy and Spain, and saw strong growth in several emerging markets, including all-time iPhone revenue records for India and Vietnam. Importantly, the installed base of active iPhones continues to grow nicely and is at an all-time high across all geographic segments.  In emerging markets, in particular, the installed base grew double digits, and we had record levels of switchers in India and in Mexico. Our customers continue to love their experience with our products with the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 98% for the iPhone 14 family.  Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, down 29% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. There were 3 key drivers for our Mac results. First, we had a challenging compare against last year's launch of the completely reimagined MacBook Pros, our first notebooks with M1 Pro and M1 Max. Second, we believe that the macro environment impacted our Mac performance. And third, we faced significant foreign exchange headwinds. At the same time, however, the installed base of active Macs reached an all-time high across all geographic segments, and we continue to see very strong upgraded activity to Apple silicon. Customer satisfaction with Mac remains very strong at 96% based on the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research.  iPad revenue was $9.4 billion, up 30% year-over-year despite significant FX headwinds. This performance was driven by 2 key items. First, during the December quarter a year ago, we experienced significant supply constraints, while this year, we had enough supply to meet demand. Second, we launched our new iPad and the iPad Pro powered by the M2 chip during the quarter. The iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, thanks to incredible customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product.  Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $13.5 billion, down 8% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was driven by significant FX headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. However, our installed base of devices in the category set a new all-time record thanks to the largest number of customers new to our smartwatch that we've ever had in a given quarter. In fact, nearly 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product.  Moving to Services. We generated $20.8 billion in revenue, a new all-time record in total and for many Services offerings in spite of a difficult foreign exchange environment, and macroeconomic headwinds impacting certain categories such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. In constant currency, we grew Services revenue double digits on top of growing 24% during the December quarter a year ago.  We remain focused on the large long-term opportunity in this category, and we continue to observe several trends that reflect the strength of our ecosystem. For example, we saw increased customer engagement with our Services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each setting a new all-time record.  Paid subscriptions also continued to grow nicely. We now have more than 935 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up more than 150 million during the last 12 months alone and nearly 4x what we had just 5 years ago.  And we continue to increase the reach and improve the quality of our offerings. For instance, Apple Pay is now available to millions of merchants in nearly 70 countries and regions. And we saw a record-breaking number of purchases made using Apple Pay globally during the holiday shopping season.  Finally, our installed base of over 2 billion active devices represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem, and it continues to grow even during difficult macroeconomic conditions, which speaks to the exceptionally high levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction and our ability to attract new customers to our platform. The growth is coming from every major product category and geographic segment, with strong double-digit increases in emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.  Turning to the enterprise market. we are seeing continued adoption of our Services for business like Apple Business Essentials, AppleCare, Tap to Pay and Apple Financial Services. For example, Mars Incorporated has expanded its use of AppleCare for Enterprise to provide timely device support and assurance for iPads deployed across their manufacturing sites. Meanwhile, HCA Healthcare has leveraged Apple Financial Services to manage the annual refresh of its entire fleet of iPhones. This not only ensures that their staff stay current on the latest Apple technology, but also provides them with significant annual savings in the process.  Let me now turn to our capital return program and our cash position. We returned over $25 billion to shareholders during the December quarter as our business continues to generate very strong cash flow. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19 billion through open market repurchases of 133 million Apple shares. We ended the quarter with $165 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1.4 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8.2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion. As a result, net cash was $54 billion at the end of the quarter, and we maintain our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time.  As we move into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the macroeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.  In total, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the December quarter. This represents an acceleration in our underlying year-over-year business performance as the December quarter benefited from an extra week. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year impact of 5 percentage points.  For Services, we expect revenue to grow year-over-year while continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. For iPhone, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to accelerate relative to the December quarter year-over-year revenue performance. For Mac and iPad, we expect revenue for both product categories to decline double digits year-over-year because of challenging compares and macroeconomic headwinds.  We expect gross margin to be between 43.5% and 44.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $13.7 billion and $13.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $100 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%.  Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock payable on February 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of February 13, 2023.  With that, let's open the call to questions.\\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, may we have the first question, please.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from David Vogt with UBS.\\nDavid Vogt: So Tim, and maybe this is for Luca as well. You talked about the supply chain returning back to normal after a very difficult October, November, but we're still seeing some disruptions across tech products, whether it's enterprise or consumer-facing. How do you think about your supply chain and maybe the levels of inventory or builds that you might need as we go forward to sort of insulate your business from these sort of episodic disruptions? Have you changed your view? And if so, how does that affect ultimately margins and sort of your balance sheet and cash flow items going forward?\\nTimothy Cook: This is Tim, David. From a supply point of view, we did see disruption from early November through most of December. And from a supply chain point of view, we're now at a point where production is what we need it to be. And so the problem is behind us.  In terms of going forward in the supply chain, we build our products everywhere. There are component parts coming from many different countries in the world, and the final assembly coming from 3 countries in the world on just iPhone. And so we continue to optimize it. We'll continue to optimize it over time and change it to continue to improve.  I think when you sort of zoom out and back up from it, the last 3 years have been a pretty difficult time between COVID and silicon shortages and the like. And I think it's -- I think we have had a very resilient supply chain in the aggregate.  In terms of supply for this quarter, which I think was one of your points, I think we're in decent supply on most products for the quarter currently.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse.\\nShannon Cross: Luca, I wanted to dig a bit more into the commentary on gross margins. The guidance, especially at 43.5% to 44.5%, is obviously quite strong. So I'm wondering what's helping you out there, assume mix and some other things. And then how should we think about what currency and hedge is going to do as we look forward? And then I have a follow-up.\\nLuca Maestri: Shannon, yes, I mean, we've had good margin for the December quarter to start with. We reported 43%. Obviously, in December, we have the benefit of leverage because of the seasonality of the business, but we also had favorable mix across the board.  Of course, foreign exchange is an issue right now. In the December quarter on a sequential basis, foreign exchange was a negative 110 basis points for us. And on a year-over-year basis, it's 300 basis points. So obviously, the FX environment has changed a lot during the last 12 months.  For March, yes, we've seen a margin expansion, 43.5% to 44.5%. We're doing a lot of work around cost, of course. Mix will continue to help, both within categories and services mix as we move away from the holiday season. But we're doing a lot of work on the cost structure, and that is paying off. Foreign exchange is still a negative, about 50 basis points sequentially, but it's mitigating. The last couple of weeks, the dollar has weakened a bit. And so hopefully, as we go through the year, hopefully, things will improve. But for now, as you correctly state, we are in a good position on margins.\\nShannon Cross: And then, Tim, can you talk a bit about China? What you're seeing -- obviously, you've had the issues with production, but I mean more on the demand side. As we've gotten through Chinese New Year and the opening, I'm just wondering, are you seeing the Chinese consumer come back? What are they buying? And how are you thinking about your position there?\\nTimothy Cook: Shannon, last quarter, we declined by 7% on a reported basis, but we actually grew on a constant currency basis. And that was despite some significant -- the supply constraints that we talked about earlier. And obviously, the sort of the COVID restrictions throughout China that happened in various different places throughout the country also impacted the demand during the quarter.  When you look at the opening that started happening in December, we saw a marked change in traffic in our stores as compared to November. And that followed through to demand as well. And I don't want to get into January. We've obviously -- January is included in the guidance, or the color rather, that Luca provided earlier. But we did see a marked change from December compared to November.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley.\\nErik Woodring: Maybe, Tim, first one for you. That 2 billion installed base -- device installed base figure, that's up, I believe, 200 million units year-over-year. That implies the strongest annual gain in new devices in your installed base basically as far back as you've provided those data points. And so I guess my 2 questions are: one, do you -- can you provide the installed base for the iPhone at year-end? And then two, is there anything that you see in this new cohort of users that might look different or similar to past cohorts, either by demographic or regions or monetization ramp? And then I have a follow-up.\\nTimothy Cook: Yes. The installed base is now over 2 billion active devices, as you mentioned. And we set records across each geographic segment and major product category. And so it was a broad-based change. Two -- I'll correct one thing you said, it's up over 150 million year-over-year. The last report we reported to be over 1.85. And so it's 150 million, which we're very proud of. We also saw strong double-digit in several of the emerging markets, which is very important to us. For example, India and Brazil as just 2 examples. So very, very strong. And obviously, it bodes well for the future.\\nErik Woodring: And then, Luca, obviously, the December quarter was negatively impacted by the production challenges. Can you just maybe unpackage where channel inventory levels are today kind of across the iPhone broadly? And then what the data that you're seeing so far this quarter is telling you about iPhone demand deferral versus kind of iPhone demand destruction and perhaps pushing some upgrades later into the year rather than into the March quarter? And that's it for me.\\nTimothy Cook: Yes. Erik, I'll take that one as well. The channel inventory levels on iPhone, we obviously ended the December quarter below our target range given the supply challenges on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. But as you think about this, keep in mind that a year ago, we also exited the December quarter below our target inventory range because of supply challenges in the year ago quarter. Not related -- not the same issue, but just as a point. And so that hopefully gives you some flavor of that.  In terms of what we're seeing in January, we've included in our color that Luca provided kind of our thinking. It's very hard to estimate the recapture because you have to know exactly what would have happened and how many people bought down. And it takes a while to get that -- to get those reports in during the quarter. And so we've made our best guess at it.  In terms of the sizing of the constraint in Q1, what we estimate, although not with precision, is that we would -- I thought we believe iPhone would have grown during the quarter had it not been for the supply shortages. So hopefully, that provides you a little bit of color.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.\\nAaron Rakers: I have two as well, if I can. I guess the first kind of question, just going back on the gross margin line. Pretty good guidance into this March quarter. I'm curious if you unpack that a little bit specific around what you're seeing as far as maybe benefits from component pricing in the guidance, if you're embedding any of that at this point.\\nLuca Maestri: Yes. Of course, with our guidance, we try to capture every aspect of our cost structure. And obviously, components are a big portion of that. So definitely, that's included. And keep in mind, again, that foreign exchange -- I mentioned earlier, I think to Shannon, that the sequential negative on FX is 50 basis points, versus a year ago, it's 270 basis points. Obviously, the U.S. dollar has moved a lot over the last 12 months. So obviously, we need to find offsets and more to the negative FX in order to be able to provide this kind of guidance. And so obviously, components are a big part of that.\\nAaron Rakers: Yes. And then kind of from a strategic perspective, given kind of the things that we're seeing out in some of your peer group, I'm curious, Tim, how you think about the role of AI in your strategy as far as particularly in the Services segment, whether you're not -- you see opportunities to excel monetization abilities within the paid subscriber base and whether or not AI, is it something that you're implementing a bit more strategically there.\\nTimothy Cook: Yes. It is a major focus of ours. It's incredible in terms of how it can enrich customers' lives. And you can look no further than some of the things that we announced in the fall with crash detection and fall detection or back a ways with ECG. I mean these things have literally saved people's lives. And so we see an enormous potential in this space to affect virtually everything we do. It's obviously a horizontal technology, not a vertical. And so it will affect every product and every service that we have.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore.\\nAmit Daryanani: I guess the first one I have is, Tim, I think based on your earlier comments that iPhones would have grown ex the production issue that implied that maybe it's a $7 billion or so impact that you had in December quarter from the production challenges on the high-end models. I'm sure it's tough to see what happens this time around. But I think historically, when you've had production issues or things like this happen, what has the consumer behavior being typically? Do they tend to go down towards the lower end models and get the phone they want quickly? Or do they just defer the production? Just from a historical perspective, I think do you typically recover what's deferred out or no?\\nTimothy Cook: It's very hard to estimate is the real answer because you have to know a lot of data, and it's usually only in hindsight that you have a more reasonable view of it. And so we put our best views in the color that Luca provided. That's kind of what I would say.\\nAmit Daryanani: All right. And then I guess maybe if I think about Services as you go forward. I know you had really good growth in Services, I think, over the last several years. But as you go forward in Services, what do you think drives the growth more so? Is it the expansion of your installed base? Or is it more going to be driven by ARPU going higher for you? I'm just curious, how do you think about those 2 buckets as you go forward?\\nLuca Maestri: Amit, there's a number of things, and I've mentioned a few of them during the call. The first step is always the installed base. Installed base is the engine for Services growth. And the fact that the installed base is growing very nicely, and it's growing in a lot of emerging markets, it's growing even faster, that gives us a larger addressable pool of customers. So that's incredibly important.  The second one is that we are seeing that the level of engagement of our customers already in our ecosystem continues to grow. We -- I mentioned that both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits. And so that bodes very well for the future. And we have a lot of transacting accounts that kind of moved to paid accounts over time.  The other aspect that is very important for us is to continue constantly to improve the reach and the quality of our services. And I give the example of Apple Pay, which it's a great example because we started off primarily in the United States. Now we've taken it to 70 markets, millions of merchants. And so obviously, payment services are -- continue to set new highs all the time for us.  And then as you've seen over the last few years, we also launched new services over time, and that obviously contributes to the growth. We're very excited. And when we look at the behavior of our installed base, we think it's very promising for the continued growth of our Services business.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar of Piper Sandler.\\nHarsh Kumar: Tim, I had a quick question on emerging markets. Seems like you're making a lot of strides in India. Potentially wanted to understand the kind of share you have in China and India. And relative to that, what would be your aspirational but sort of achievable share in iPhones in those territories, whether it's units or revenues? And I was hoping to draw on your experience and maybe what you've seen in other countries where you've had some longer presence.\\nTimothy Cook: And looking at the business in India, we set a quarterly revenue record and grew very strong double digits year-over-year. And so we feel very good about how we performed, and that was -- that's despite the headwinds that we've talked about. Taking a step back, India is a hugely exciting market for us and is a major focus. We brought the online store there in 2020. We will soon bring Apple retail there. So we're putting a lot of emphasis on the market. There's been a lot done from a financing options and trade-ins to make products more affordable and give people more options to buy. And so there's a lot going on there.  We are, in essence, taking what we learned in China years ago and how we scale to China and bringing that to bear. And I don't have the exact market shares in front of me, but I think you would see that from a market share point of view that we grew around the world last quarter despite -- on iPhone despite the challenges that we've had on the supply side. And I wouldn't expect to have a difference in those 2 markets.\\nHarsh Kumar: Understood. And for my follow-up, I had a sort of interesting theoretical question on pricing. Assuming we get the CHIPS Act passed, and there's a whole bunch of manufacturing that happens in U.S. and other territories that are potentially somewhat more expensive than the ones you might be now, have you -- has the company done any studies to gauge the elasticity of demand relative to small price increases in your products?\\nTimothy Cook: We have experience in that, but I wouldn't necessarily draw the same conclusion that you have in terms of the cost of the product. I -- we don't know at this point exactly what that will be, but we're all in, in terms of being the largest customer for TSMC in Arizona. I'm very proud to take part in that. That's what I would say about that.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.\\nWamsi Mohan: Tim, you've done a phenomenal job of driving consumer choice towards higher-end products within your portfolio. How would you compare this cycle for iPhones if you were to segment the Pro versus non-Pro models versus the cycles from the past few years? And do you think this move to higher ASPs is sustainable? Or do you think it reverses in a tighter consumer spending environment? And I have a follow-up.\\nTimothy Cook: The Pro has been a -- the 14 Pro and the 14 Pro Max have done extremely well up until the point where we had a supply shortage and couldn't provide them -- couldn't provide the total of the demand. And so it's definitely a strong Pro cycle. I think there's a number of reasons for that, but the most important one is always the product. And I think the innovations and the product speak for themselves. And we feel very good about the product that we announced back in September and are happy to now be at a point where we're shipping to the demand.\\nWamsi Mohan: And Tim, do you think that this move to sort of higher ASPs that has happened over the last few years is sustainable? Or could it sustain in this very tough macro environment that you've cited?\\nTimothy Cook: I wouldn't want to predict, but I would say that the smartphone for us, the iPhone has become so integral into people's lives. It contains their contacts and their health information and their banking information and their smart home and so many different parts of their lives, their payment vehicle and -- for many people. And so I think people are willing to really stretch to get the best they can afford in that category.\\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Great. And Tim, you clearly emphasize the focus and importance of the installed base. If we think about the absolute grit of the installed base from 1 billion to 2 billion over 7 years from a device standpoint, how should we think about the penetration of services or the growth in paying customers on services or that time frame? Is that penetration rate increasing or decreasing? How fast is that growing relative to the growth of the overall installed base?\\nLuca Maestri: Wamsi, it's Luca. Yes, of course, we keep track of that. It's really important for us. Over the last 7 years, as we doubled the installed base, we've seen a growing engagement of our customers on the platform. That happens, first of all, by customers transacting on the platform and then moving to paid accounts. So starting to pay for some of the services. That percentage of paid accounts tends to grow over time. We've seen it in developed markets. We see it in emerging markets. And that is due to some of the reasons that I was explaining earlier, including the fact that we made it easier for our customers to get engaged on the platform. For example, we offer multiple payment methods in many countries. And we've made it easier to explore for more services because we've added a lot of services on the platform over the last 7 years. So to your question, of course, higher engagement means a higher percentage of paid accounts over time.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Kramer of Arete Research LLP.\\nTejas Gala: Operator, can we move on to the next?\\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Jim Suva of Citigroup.\\nJames Suva: Tim and Luca, you both mentioned earlier on the Q&A a little bit about India. I was wondering if we're now entering a situation of even more opportunity because we've exited COVID, we've exited countries with different COVID criteria. We've also seen India build out its higher speed transmissions. And your market is -- shares tremendously underrepresented there. And it appears with the supply chain, you're looking at diversifying kind of operational risk not specific to any country, but just overall. Now you look at potentially opening up stores and stuff. Am I right that, that's the way you look at it is it's even more prime for opportunity now than ever? And once you start opening up stores there, you could just see a complete green shoot of adoptions or any additional commentary on your view on India as now we've navigated COVID and supply chain and so many challenges over the past 2 years?\\nTimothy Cook: Yes. Jim, we actually did fairly well through COVID in India. And I'm even more bullish now on the other side of it, or hopefully, on the other side of it. And that's the reason why we're investing there. We're bringing retail there and bringing the online store there and putting a significant amount of energy there. I'm very bullish on India.\\nJames Suva: And then as my quick follow-up, you had mentioned that Services, not necessarily specific to India, but Services overall were better than expected. And of course, supply chain was more challenged than expected. So what was the bridge factor of Services being better than expected on upside? Was it like advertising or apps or paid monthly subscriptions? Or what were kind of the things that really surprised you to the upside on Services?\\nLuca Maestri: It was -- Jim, it's Luca. It's primarily the -- this level of engagement we saw, which then reflects into the, as you said, the paid subscriptions. We saw very good results in our cloud services business in payment services. Music was very strong. So we had a number of categories that set new records, all-time records. And they did a bit better than we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter.  And so Tim mentioned that during, I think, his prepared remarks that when you look at it in constant currency, we grew services double digits. And that was on top of a 24% increase a year ago. So it's very sustained growth that we're seeing.\\nOperator: Our next question will come from Krish Sankar of Cowen and Company.\\nKrish Sankar: I have 2. The first one, Tim and Luca, you mentioned how the macro did soften, and it has an impact. And as consumers tighten their belt, when you look across your hardware products and service businesses, where are you seeing the biggest impact and where are you seeing the least impact from the softening macro? And then I had a quick follow-up.\\nTimothy Cook: We think there were some impact across the products and in Services. Probably, the ones that we saw the most impact on were Mac and Wearables. You can see that in those numbers. And probably, the least would have been iPhone.\\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Very helpful, Tim. And then just a quick follow-up on the Mac. The PC industry is expecting a decline in PC shipments this year also. How do you think about the Mac relative to kind of like where the PC industry as a whole is expecting the shipments to end up? Is there any color you can give on that?\\nTimothy Cook: The industry is very challenged, as you say. It's -- the industry is contracting. I think from us, though, is -- and I don't know how this year will play out, so I don't want to predict the year. But over the long run, we have a market that is a reasonable-sized market, a big market. And we have low share, and we have a competitive advantage with Apple silicon. And so strategically, I think we're well positioned in the market, albeit I think it will be a little rough in the short term.\\nTejas Gala: A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\\nTim Cook: Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. Over the past year, despite a range of challenges facing the world, our teams have come together in incredible ways to drive unparalleled innovation and deliver again and again for our customers. For the September quarter, we reported record revenue of $90.1 billion, which was better than we anticipated despite stronger-than-expected foreign currency headwinds. We set an all-time revenue record for Mac and September quarter records for iPhone and Wearables, Home and Accessories. Services notched a September quarter record as well with revenue of $19.2 billion and more than 900 million paid subscriptions. We reached another record on our installed base of active devices, thanks to a quarterly record of upgraders and double-digit growth in switchers on iPhone. Across nearly every geographic segment, we reached a new revenue record for the quarter. And we continue to perform incredibly well in emerging markets with very strong double-digit growth in India, Southeast Asia and Latin America. I'm also happy to report that during the quarter, silicon-related supply constraints were not significant. I want to acknowledge that we are still living through unprecedented times. From war in Eastern Europe to the persistence of COVID-19, from climate disasters around the world to an increasingly difficult economic environment, a lot of people and a lot of places are struggling. Through it all, we've aimed to help our customers navigate through the challenges while giving them the tools to drive progress for themselves and their communities. At Apple, creativity and collaboration have always been at the core of who we are. That spirit of ingenuity and teamwork helped us provide our customers with incredible innovations this year and led to another yearly revenue record. In fiscal 2022, Apple achieved revenue of $394 billion, representing 8% annual growth. We set records for iPhone, Mac, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services while growing double digits in emerging markets and setting records in the vast majority of markets we track. Customers are loving our iPhone 14 lineup. Loaded with camera upgrades for sharper photos, Action Mode for smoother videos and new safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite, iPhone is even more indispensable to our daily lives. iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus come with a new dual-camera system, industry-leading durability, incredible power and amazing battery life. And our iPhone 14 Pro models are packed with even more groundbreaking innovations, including a new camera system as well as always-on display and the Dynamic Island, which offers a whole new way to interact with iPhone. Just yesterday, our most advanced iPad and iPad Pro ever landed in stores. With its all-screen design, advanced cameras and faster wireless connectivity, the tenth generation iPad looks and performs better than ever. For creatives, iPad Pro, now turbocharged by the blazingly fast M2 chip, is the perfect device to make something amazing. Our Mac customers have already been raving about the power of M2 since the arrival of our newest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro this summer. Their incredible long battery life, stunningly rich display and lightning fast speeds are a signature part of the Mac experience and helped drive an all-time record revenue for Mac during the September quarter. In Wearables, Home and Accessories a wave of innovation spurred 10% year-over-year revenue growth during the September quarter. New features in Apple Watch Series 8, including temperature sensing capabilities, retrospective ovulation estimates and crash detection are helping to keep customers healthier and safer. And the updated Apple Watch SE is a great way for users to start their Apple Watch journey, delivering advanced features at a new low price. The biggest, brightest and boldest Apple Watch ever made, Apple Watch Ultra pushes the boundaries of what a smartwatch can do.  Packed with innovations like advanced navigation tools and the new Oceanic+ app, which turns it into a dive computer, Apple Watch Ultra has something for athletes and adventures on land and sea. The second generation of AirPods Pro powered by the new H2 chip are receiving rave reviews for delivering an unmatched wireless earbud audio experience, while canceling up to twice as much noise over the previous model. There's no better place to discover the rich spatial audio capabilities of AirPods Pro than Apple Music, the largest music catalog anywhere now with more than 100 million songs. And there's no other company that fuses best-in-class hardware with cutting-edge software and services to create a truly integrated and seamless experience. With iOS 16, we're giving customers more ways to personalize their iPhones through a customizable lock screen and focus filters. New features in Messages and Mail enable users to connect and collaborate like never before. Stage Manager in iPadOS 16 and macOS Ventura, helps users stay more productive with smoother multitasking. And watchOS 9 is empowering customers to live a healthier day through updates to the Sleep App, a new FDA-cleared AFib history feature and the new Medications app. Across our Services, we continue to see enthusiasm and strong engagement from our subscribers. Apple TV+ hits like Severance, Bad Sisters and Blackbird have taken center stage on screens around the world. And baseball fans were glued to their seats this season watching Friday Night Baseball. Meanwhile, Apple TV+ productions continue to earn accolades. At the 74th Primetime Emmy Awards in September, Apple brought home 9 statues, including a second consecutive win for Best Comedy Series for Ted Lasso. And soon, we're going to give audiences an even better entertainment experience when the all-new Apple TV 4K hit stores next week. We're also bringing Fitness+ to more customers than ever by making our entire library of over 3,000 studio-style workouts and meditations available to iPhone users in 21 countries, even those without an Apple Watch. These updates are arriving just in time for a new Artist Spotlight series with workouts featuring the music of Taylor Swift and a new workout program, Yoga for Every Runner featuring and design with one of the world's top ultramarathon athletes, Scott Jurek. While Fitness+ helps subscribers stay active, Apple Card is designed with our customers' financial health in mind. For the second year in a row, Apple Card has been ranked highest in customer satisfaction for midsized credit card issuers by J.D. Power. And our users' favorite Apple Card benefit just got even better with the upcoming addition of a new high-yield savings account to help them save and grow their daily cash rewards. Turning to retail. Last month, our team members welcomed customers to the all-new Apple Jamsil in South Korea. And through today at Apple Creative Studios, we partnered with non-profits in cities around the world to help young diverse creatives pursue their passions and connect with local mentors. And our retail teams have done exceptional work, helping customers explore our latest products and features. As we approach the holiday season with our product lineup set, I'd like to share my gratitude to our retail, AppleCare and channel teams for the work they are doing to support customers. At Apple, we're proud of the ways we are able to help customers be productive, get healthy, stay safe and unlock their creative potential. We also understand we have important responsibilities to the communities we serve. That's why we continue to invest in education, racial equity and justice and the environment. And we are making important progress toward a more inclusive and diverse workforce. Through our Community Education Initiative, we're working alongside more than 150 partners to help students around the world learn new science and technology skills. This summer, we joined with community partners to support coding academies across the United States from Code Academy in Nashville to One Summer Chicago to the Coding 5K Camp for Girls right next door in San Jose. We've also just expanded our racial equity and justice initiative into the UK for the first time. Alongside the South Pink Center, we're helping aspiring creators develop their own voices and position themselves for long-lasting careers. Back in the US, we welcomed a new class of Black, Latino and indigenous entrepreneurs to Apple's second Impact Accelerator. This group of innovators is focused on using green technology to mitigate the effects of climate change and serve communities most affected by it. At Apple, we care deeply about protecting the planet for future generations. To that end, in support of our 2030 environmental goals, we have asked all of our suppliers to become carbon-neutral across their entire Apple-related footprint by the end of the decade. We are also providing them with resources based on what we learned achieving net-zero carbon in our own global operations. Across our entire product lineup, we also continue to source more materials through recycling while taking less from the Earth. Every iPhone 14 is made with 100% recycled rare-earth elements in all magnets, including those used in MagSafe. And in a first for Apple Watch and iPad, we're using recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards in our newest devices. While we're working to reduce the footprint of our hardware, we're making changes to our software to be more environmentally-friendly with the soon-to-be released Clean Energy charging feature for iPhone. Our 2030 goal is a reflection of our relentless focus on the future at Apple. The world continues to be unpredictable as old challenges evolve and new ones emerge. What remains constant is the ability of our teams to create great products, services and experiences while being a force for good in the world. Whatever challenges lie ahead in the new year, we're moving forward, as we always have, investing for the long-term to deliver incredible innovations for our customers like only Apple can. And now, I'll hand it over to Luca for more details on our performance.\\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report record financial results for the September quarter that capped another record fiscal year for Apple despite a challenging and volatile macroeconomic backdrop. We reached a September quarter revenue record of $90.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year despite over 600 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact, with new September quarter records in the Americas, Europe, Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific. Importantly, in constant currency, we grew nicely in each of our geographic segments, with strong double-digit growth outside the US. Products revenue was $71 billion, up 9% over last year despite FX headwinds and a record for the September quarter. And it was a September quarter revenue record for iPhone and Wearables, Home and Accessories and an all-time revenue record for Mac. Overall, our installed base of active devices continue to grow nicely. It reached an all-time high for all major product categories and geographic segments at the end of the quarter, thanks to extremely strong customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers that are new to our products. Our Services set a September quarter revenue record of $19.2 billion, up 5% over a year ago despite over 600 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. We reached September quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific and also in many Services categories, including all-time revenue records for cloud services and payment services. Company gross margin was a September quarter record at 42.3%. It was down 100 basis points from last quarter due to unfavorable foreign exchange and a different mix, partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 34.6%, up 10 basis points sequentially, with improved leverage and favorable mix partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 70.5%, down 100 basis points sequentially, primarily due to foreign exchange. Net income of $20.7 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.29 and operating cash flow of $24.1 billion were all September quarter records. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 10% year-over-year to a September quarter record of $42.6 billion, despite significant foreign exchange headwinds. We set September quarter records in the vast majority of markets we track, and our performance was particularly impressive in several large emerging markets, with India setting a new all-time revenue record and Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Mexico more than doubling year-over-year. Thanks to our strong iPhone lineup, we set a quarterly record for upgraders and grew switchers double digits. This level of sales performance, along with unmatched customer loyalty, drove the active installed base of iPhones to a new all-time high across all geographic segments. And the latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%. It was a great quarter for Mac. We achieved an all-time revenue record of $11.5 billion, up 25% year-over-year, despite significant FX headwinds. There were three key items that helped drive this performance. First, we benefited from the launch of our new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro powered by the M2 chip. Second, we were able to satisfy pent-up demand that carried forward from the significant supply constraints we faced during the June quarter. Third, as our supply position improved, we were able to fill the channel. Importantly, our investment in the category has attracted both upgraders and customers new to Mac and helped our installed base reach an all-time high. In fact, we set a quarterly record for upgraders, while nearly half of customers buying Macs during the quarter were new to the device. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, down 13% year-over-year due to significant negative foreign exchange and a challenging compare due to the launch of new iPads a year ago. Despite this, the iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, thanks to incredible customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9.7 billion, growing 10% year-over-year, driven by the launch of Apple Watch and new AirPods Pro. This level of safe performance along with very strong new tool rates, drove our installed base of devices in the category to a new all-time record. For instance, two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. Moving to Services, as I mentioned, we set a September quarter record in aggregate and in most geographic segments, generating $19.2 billion in revenue in spite of very large foreign exchange headwinds. It is important to remember, that we achieved double-digit constant currency growth in Services on top of growing 26% during the September quarter a year ago. However, certain services were impacted by macroeconomic headwinds, including foreign exchange. Digital advertising and gaming are areas where we've seen some softness. Throughout the quarter, we continued to observe several trends that reflect the strength of our ecosystem and our long-term opportunity in the category. First, our continued installed base growth across each geographic segment and each major product category represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem. Second, we saw increased customer engagement with our Services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each setting a new all-time record. The percentage of accounts that pay for our services continues to increase, and we still see plenty of opportunity ahead of us. Third, paid subscriptions showed very strong growth. We now have more than 900 million paid subscriptions across the Services on our platform, up more than 155 million during the last 12 months alone and double what we had just three years ago. We continue investing in new content and features, across our service offerings. For example, we added several popular sports titles to Apple Arcade. We're also excited about our global partnership with Major League Soccer, where starting next season, fans can stream every single MLS match through the Apple TV app. This momentum helped us achieve over $78 billion in Services revenue during fiscal 2022, a new record and up 14% year-over-year. We continue to invest confidently and believe strongly in the long-term potential of our Services business, which is already the size of a Fortune 50 business on its own, and has nearly doubled during the last four years. It was not only a record year for Services but also for our entire company. During the past four quarters, we grew our business by 8% or $29 billion, reaching more than $394 billion of revenue. We grew diluted earnings per share by 9% and generated over $111 billion of free cash flow, up 20% year-over-year. It was also a strong year for our enterprise business, as we set new annual records for iPhone, iPad and Mac during fiscal 2022 and grew strong double-digits year-over-year as our devices and services continue to help more-and-more companies empower their employees and serve their customers. For instance, Ford Manufacturing employees are using iPad and iPhone to help further improve the quality of its game-changing Ford F-150 Lightning electric trucks. iPhone's powerful A-series chip and advanced camera systems, along with third-party iOS apps, are enabling Ford to automate the visual quality inspection process in real-time to help address issues before they impact customers. And Cisco expanded its Macs as a choice program and is now offering it to all its employees to help attract and retain top talent. And when given this choice, employees have chosen Macs twice as often as other options. In addition, many enterprise customers are taking advantage of the high residual value of our products and simple trade-in process to standardize the refresh cycles for their fleets of Apple devices. This allows employees to upgrade to the latest devices regularly while making it highly predictable and cost effective for the business. Let me now turn to our cash position. Our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, which enabled us to return over $29 billion to shareholders during the September quarter. This included $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25.2 billion through open market repurchases of 160 million Apple shares. We ended the quarter with $169 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.8 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $1 billion while issuing $5.5 billion of new debt, leaving us with total debt of $120 billion. As a result, net cash was $49 billion at the end of the quarter as we continue to make progress toward our goal of becoming net cash neutral over time. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the macroeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Overall, we believe total company year-over-year revenue performance will decelerate during the December quarter as compared to the September quarter for a number of reasons. First, we expect nearly 10 percentage points of negative year-over-year impact from foreign exchange.  Second, on Mac, in addition to increasing FX headwinds, we have a very challenging compare against last year, which had the benefit of the launch and associated channel fill of our newly redesigned MacBook Pro with M1. Therefore, we expect Mac revenue to decline substantially year-over-year during the December quarter. Specifically on Services, we expect to grow but to be impacted by the macroeconomic environment increasingly affecting foreign exchange, digital advertising and gaming. We expect gross margin to be between 42.5% and 43.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.7 billion and $14.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock, payable on November 10, 2022, to shareholders of record as of November 7, 2022. With that, let's open the call to questions.\\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we please have the first question?\\nOperator: We'll go ahead and take our first question from Shannon Cross calling from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \\nQ – Shannon Cross: Thank you very much. It's great to talk to you on the call again. I'm wondering, can you just talk a bit about how you're thinking about this iPhone generation? On the positive side, you've raised prices. It seems to be mixing up. On the negative side, investors are concerned about impacted demand from the higher prices, what Huawei meant to you in prior years versus what could happen now. There are just some pressures out there. So I'm curious if you can kind of talk to what you're seeing initially in iPhone demand and how you think it will move through. With the caveat that I understand, things are pretty uncertain out there. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\\nTim Cook: Shannon, it's Tim. Welcome back. iPhone grew 10% in the Q4 timeframe to $42.6 billion. Customer demand was strong and better than we anticipated that it would be. And keep in mind that this is on top of a fiscal year of 2021 that had iPhone revenue grow by 39%, and so it's a tough compare as well. And so we were happy with it. In terms of the new products, the 14 and the 14 Pro and Pro Max, the -- it's still very early. But since the beginning, we've been constrained on the 14 Pro and the 14 Pro Max and we continue to be constrained today. And so we're working very hard to fulfill the demand. It's difficult to say what the mix will be until we can satisfy the demand because we don't really -- we're not able to determine the accurate mix until then. And so we -- but we're working very hard to do that. We were really pleased with the broadness of the iPhone strength last quarter. We had three of the top four smartphones in the U.S. and the UK, the top three in Urban China, the top six in Australia, four out of the top five in Germany and the top two in Japan. And customer satisfaction for the iPhone remains very, very strong at 98%. And so we feel very good about how we performed in Q4. And certainly, the start of this generation would suggest that we're going to be constrained for a little while on the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. But we're working very hard to try to remedy that.\\nShannon Cross: Thank you. And then, Luca, can you talk a bit about gross margin puts and takes? Just how we should think about, I mean, 10 basis points of currency this coming quarter is, I don't want to say unprecedented, but maybe it is. So I know you have hedges, but how do we think about it flowing through? And then what other -- components seem to be very favorable. But what else should we throw into the mix as we look forward?\\nLuca Maestri: Yeah. Well, let me start with gross margin in Q4 and then I'll get to Q1. It was a September quarter record for the company. We did 42.3%, and that is in spite of, as you mentioned, very significant negative FX in -- for example, for Q4, on a sequential basis, FX was negative 70 basis points and on a year-over-year basis it was negative 170 basis points. Essentially every currency around the world has weakened against the dollar. Now, we have guided Q1 to 42.5% to 43.5% in spite of the fact that we have, on a year-over-year basis, 330 basis points of negative exchange. Sequentially, it's 120 basis points unfavorable. So obviously, the strong dollar makes it difficult in a number of areas. Obviously, our pricing in emerging markets makes it difficult, and the translation of that revenue back into dollars is affected. But on the positive side, we are seeing commodities behave fairly favorably for us. And so we believe we can offset the foreign exchange – the negative foreign exchange that we're seeing. And I think that the guidance that we provided reflects that. It takes into account, of course, FX. It takes into account some level of inflationary pressures. But I think the outcome is, I think, is a good one.\\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you very much.\\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: Yes, sir. Our next question is coming from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.\\nErik Woodring: Hey, guys, thanks very much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Maybe if we could just start. Luca, we saw quite the divergence in iPad and Mac performance this quarter. Both were relatively constrained from a supply perspective. So maybe can you just elaborate on some of the most impacted -- important factors that contributed to kind of the divergence in performance and whether after we get through the December quarter, those can reverse or normalize? And then I have a follow-up.\\nA – Tim Cook: Yeah, Erik, it's Tim. I'll take your question. On – if you look at the Mac, the Mac, it was the best quarter we've ever had in the history of the company. It was helped by the product launch of the MacBook Air with M2. It was helped that in the previous quarter, in the June quarter, if you remember, we lost output from the factory for a significant portion of the quarter. And so we had a backlog exiting our Q3 headed into Q4. We were able to satisfy all of that demand during Q4 and filled the channel for the Mac. And so that led to an incredible Mac quarter. If you look at iPad, iPad had sort of the opposite happening from a launch point of view. The comp from a year ago, we launched iPads in September. We launched iPads this year in October. The other point to remember is that the iPad Pro had just launched before the quarter started in the year-ago quarter so it was our first full quarter of iPad Pro. So it was an exceptionally strong iPad quarter a year ago, and the launches were really key to that performance. And so that's the reason iPad contracted during this quarter.\\nErik Woodring: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you, Tim. And then maybe, Luca, if I were just to ask you, obviously, Tejas at the beginning of the call talked about the 14-week quarter. Maybe can you just elaborate a little bit on how you think that 14-week quarter impacts different line items, whether it's products or certain segments within the product business or the Services stand-alone? Just where we should see that 14-week quarter provide a bit more of a tailwind versus maybe not have an impact at all? And that's it for me. Thanks. \\nLuca Maestri: In general, we have a few more days in the quarter that we're going to -- are going to affect both our revenues and our costs. Not every week is equal because obviously, we have certain peaks during the course of the quarter. Think about Black Friday or the Christmas holiday. But, in general, we're adding a few days of sale and additional OpEx as well on the cost front. So that's what happens to us every approximately six years as we need to align our weekly calendar to the fiscal calendar.\\nErik Woodring: Super. Thanks, guys.\\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Erik. Can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator: Yes, sir. The next question is coming from Ben Bollin calling from Cleveland Research.\\nBen Bollin: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Tim, I was hoping we could talk a little bit about services, pieces within the portfolio. It looks like there's been some price adjustments as of late with respect to Music, TV+ and the One bundle. I'm curious how you think about balancing the consumer price versus your own costs and kind of the associated follow-through. And then I have a follow-up.\\nTim Cook: Yes. If you look at the price increase that you referenced, Ben, on Monday of this week, we announced a price increase on Apple Music and on Apple TV+ and then the corresponding Apple One, that is the consolidated bundle that includes both of those. On -- there's really two different situations here. With Music, the cost of licensing increased. And so we are paying more for music. The good thing about that is the artist will also get more money for their songs that are enjoyed on streaming. And so there's some bit of good news there, I suppose. And then on Apple TV+, if you look at when we first priced it, we only had a very few shows. We were at the beginning. We are very focused on originals only, and so we had four or five shows or so in the beginning and priced it quite low. We now have a lot more content and are coming out on -- with more each and every month. And so, we've increased the price to represent the value of the service. And of course, Apple One is just the consolidation of those two price changes.\\nBen Bollin: Okay. And then, another item. Any preliminary thoughts around capital intensity into fiscal 2023? Last couple of years, CapEx has been relatively stable. Can you talk to the big constituents of the CapEx figure and maybe any moving pieces and how we could think about that to 2023? Thank you.\\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Ben. So when we look at our CapEx, as you correctly said, I mean, we've been fairly stable, and I think our capital intensity is really very good. We have three major buckets in CapEx for the company. We have certain dedicated tools for the manufacturing facilities. We had some spend around data centers, and we have spend around our office facilities around the world. We obviously monitor all of them. There is nothing unusual that we see for the next 12 months.\\nBen Bollin: Okay. Thanks, guys.\\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Ben. Can we have our next question, please\\nOperator: Yes, sir. Our next question is coming from Kyle McNealy calling from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\\nKyle McNealy: Hi, thanks very much. Just wanted to see if you could give us a sense for what drove the Wearables result and the strength there this quarter. Was it from the maybe strong iPhone attach rates or the new products that you have available that were announced this quarter, or maybe you're still getting some benefit from customers that are more willing to come into the store now and try things on versus the pandemic when that was kind of shut down?\\nTim Cook: Yes. Kyle, it's Tim. The -- if you look at Wearables, we grew 10%, which we were very happy with. If you look at the individual pieces of that, Apple Watch was a contributor. And in particular, the new lineup was a contributor, including the Apple Watch Ultra and the Apple Watch Series 8 and the SE. The Ultra is -- was supply constrained and continues to be supply constrained during this quarter thus far. And so we're working hard to satisfy the demand bearing, get those products to customers. We also announced and launched the AirPods Pro in September. And the reviews for the product have just been off the charts in terms of the noise cancellation features and the sound quality. We're getting great, great reviews from there. In terms of what played the other way, the headwinds, obviously, FX was a headwind that affected Wearables, Home and Accessories, just like it affected the rest of our products and services. And we also had effect from the business in Russia, obviously, or the impact there. So that's sort of the pro and the con. The other thing that I should mention is that about two-thirds of the Apple Watches that we sold were to customers that had not previously owned an Apple Watch. And so the -- we're still very much selling to new customers here, which is very, very good for the future.\\nKyle McNealy: Okay, great. One more quick one on Mac. I wanted to see if you could quantify at all how much the channel fill and how much came from satisfying back orders from the June period for Mac. We're just trying to get a sense for where the baseline is, if there's any sense you can give us on that. What would it have grown if not for those factors? Anything you can give us would be great. Thanks.\\nTim Cook: Yes. I would just say that all three of the reasons that I gave were key in achieving the 25%. The M2 MacBook Air, the launch of the new product, the -- satisfying the back orders from the previous quarter and then filling the channel, all of those were key contributors.\\nKyle McNealy: Okay, Tim. Thanks.\\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Kyle. Can we have our next question, please\\nOperator: Yes, sir. The next question is coming from Mr. Jim Suva calling from Citigroup.\\nJim Suva: Thank you and it's great to see that you talked about your suppliers going carbon-neutral, something -- a small statement I really took to heart. Thank you. My question is on the Services. Could it possibly be impacted more by FX than product, meaning the Jim Suva family has Apple One and TV+ and all that, and we pay typically on annual, but then when we go into the store to buy new Watches and iPad, the price is adjusted more quickly. So could it be that Services growth was impacted a little bit more by FX and down the road, we could see growth reaccelerate, or am I just reading too much into the FX impact that could be different from Services versus product? Thank you.\\nLuca Maestri: Jim, it's Luca. No, you're right. Obviously, the FX impact on our business depends on the geographic mix of the sales that we do. And so yes, it can be -- Services and products can have slightly different effects on foreign exchange. And so, if we look at our Services business in constant currency, we would have grown double digits. And so we're very pleased with that. As I mentioned, there were some areas that we could see some softness in digital advertising. Of course, you know that part, and gaming on the App Store was affected. But we were very happy with what we saw in terms of the behavior of our customers with the engagement with Services. And I mentioned a number of things during the prepared remarks, the fact that, obviously, that installed base is growing, that's a positive and it's a great foundation for the future. We are seeing more transacting accounts and more paid accounts, they're both growing double digits. Paid accounts are growing faster than transacting accounts, so the penetration of paid accounts is increasing. We have a great subscription business, 900 million paid subs now on the platform and growing very fast. We doubled in 3 years. So when we look at all those dynamics, that's the part that is really interesting to us because we really believe that the engine for Services growth is there and foreign exchange is a temporary thing and – but the fundamentals are very good.\\nJim Suva: Thank you. Congratulations for your team.\\nTejas Gala: Thanks Jim. Can we have the next question, please.\\nOperator: The next question is coming from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Please go ahead. \\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I have 2 as well. The first 1 really is around the iPhone trajectory. There's been a fair amount of focus in terms of what's going to happen to iPhone demand, given the macro worries. It would be really helpful to understand though, given the strength you're seeing, where do you think channel inventory is for iPhones today versus where it would be from a historical perspective? And do you see the channel getting to an optimal level by end of December quarter? Because evenly right now given the lead time data, it looks like your revenue trajectory in iPhones is more driven by the supply you have versus demand. So any color on the channel inventory would be helpful.\\nTim Cook: Yes. If you look at where we ended, Amit, in the September quarter, we exited below our target inventory range on iPhone and that's -- that in and of itself is not too unusual in the quarter. We start the ramp and demand is robust and so forth. And so I wouldn't call it that abnormal from the past.\\nQ – : Got it. And then I guess, Tim, you folks have been talking about digital advertising a fair bit over the last few quarters, I think. Is there any metrics, any vectors you can talk about kind of to give us a sense of how big those businesses or what vectors are you focused on? And really, if you could talk about, do you think Apple can build an advertising business at scale without sacrificing consumer privacy?\\nTim Cook: So our -- first and foremost, we focus on privacy and so we would not do anything that stepped away from that. We feel that privacy is a basic fundamental human right, and so that's sort of the lens that we look at it under. Our specific advertising business is not large and relative to others and so forth. But we don't release the exact numbers on it, but it's clearly not large.\\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please.\\nOperator: Yes, sir. We'll now move on to Mr. Harsh Kumar calling from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. \\nHarsh Kumar: Yeah. Hey, thanks guys, First of all, fellows congratulations on stellar performance. There's a lot of large-cap companies that are getting ripped around, so we appreciate the steady cadence here. Tim, I wanted to ask you about inflation pressures and labor problems here in the US and globally. And maybe talk about what steps can Apple take to mitigate those? And maybe Luca, on that end, FX is becoming a pretty significant headwind. I was curious what -- if at all, if there's anything that can be done to mitigate that.\\nTim Cook: I'll let Luca talk about FX. In terms of the people piece, we're focused on taking care of our teams and offering them the best benefits and best compensation so that we can empower them to do the best work of their lives. And so that's what we're focused on in terms of our teams. In terms of inflation, there's clearly wage inflation. There's inflation related to logistics as well. If you compare it to pre-pandemic kind of levels, that has not returned to pre pandemic levels by any means. And there's certain silicon components that are -- have inflationary pressure as well. And so that's not an all-inclusive list of where we see it, but it gives you some ingredients of where we see inflation pressure. And we've obviously taken that into consideration in the gross margin guidance that Luca gave earlier in the call.\\nLuca Maestri: Yes. And on foreign exchange, you're right. I mean, it's obviously a very significant factor that is affecting our results, both revenue and gross margin. What do we do about situation like this, one where we have a very strong dollar? Of course, we hedge our exposures. We try to hedge them in as many places as possible around the world. For example, I think we've been probably the first company that started hedging our exposure in China several years ago. There may be a few currency, small ones, where we don't hedge because the cost is prohibitive or the market is not there. But in general, we tend to hedge because it gives us significant level of margin stability. Obviously, over time, that protection reduces because the hedges roll over and we need to buy new contracts. But that's the primary tool that we use to offset some of the FX pressure. Of course, when we launch new products, in particular, we look at the FX situation. And in some cases, for example, customers in international markets had to -- they saw some price increases when we launched the new products, which is not something that, for example, US customers have seen. And that's unfortunately the situation that we're in right now with the strong dollar. So that's the way we try to deal with that. I have to say that one of the things that we've really appreciated the most during the quarter was the fact that in spite of this very strong dollar and the difficult FX environment, we have seen very strong performance in many international markets, particularly some very large emerging markets where even in reported currencies, so in US dollars, we're seeing very strong double-digit growth in places like India, Indonesia, Mexico, Vietnam, many places where we've done incredibly well. And obviously, in local currency, those growth rates are even higher. It's important for us to look at how these markets perform in local currency because it really gives us a good sense for the customer response to our products, the engagement with our ecosystem and in general, the strength of the brand. And I have to say, in that respect, we feel very, very good about the progress that we're making in a lot of markets around the world.\\nHarsh Kumar: Thanks, Tim and Luca. I had a follow-up. Luca, in your prepared remarks for the guidance, you mentioned that for the December quarter, you expect the performance to decelerate relative to September. So September was a year-over-year about, call it, 8%. Should I think that, that 8% number will go down on a year-over-year basis as we look at December? Maybe you could provide some color on what you're thinking. And are we still looking -- are we looking at a positive number, or are we thinking maybe that the growth rate will be negative on a year-over-year basis?\\nLuca Maestri: What we said is that we're going to be decelerating from September, so September was 8%, so it's going to be a lower percentage than 8%. We're not providing guidance for the reasons that we've explained. There's a lot of uncertainty there. And so we see how the quarter progresses. Keep in mind the 10 points of exchange. Certainly, in normal times, we will be talking about very different numbers, but that's where we are right now.\\nHarsh Kumar: Thank you guys.\\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Harsh. Can we have the next question please.\\nOperator: Yes, sir. Next question is coming from Krish Sankar calling from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.\\nKrish Sankar: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one, either for Tim or Luca, on cash and capital allocation. Given there's some correction and valuation for some of the private and public companies, does it change your thought process on the time line to get to cash-neutral? In other words, would you be more aggressive with acquisitions, or you think holding on to more cash due to interest income becomes more attractive versus your prior investment goals? And then I had a quick follow-up.\\nTim Cook: This is Tim. In terms of acquisitions, we averaged about one per month, I believe, in across fiscal year 2022. And so we're constantly looking in the market. And what's out there. And what things would be synergistic. And which things would provide either intellectual property or talent or preferably both that we would need. And so we're constantly looking at acquisitions of all sizes.\\nLuca Maestri: In terms of cash deployment, obviously, we like to look at the capital return program over the long arc of time. And we have done, since the beginning of the program we've done over $550 billion of buyback at an average repurchase price of $47. So the program has been incredibly successful. We are still in a position where we have net cash. And we said all along, we want to get to cash-neutral at some point. Our cash generation has been very, very strong over the years, particularly last year. I think, I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did $111 billion of free cash flow. That's up 20% year-over-year. And so we will put that capital to use for investors.\\nKrish Sankar: Got it, got it, very helpful, Tim and Luca. And then a quick follow-up for Luca on the December guidance, thanks for the color on that. I'm just kind of curious, the extra week in the quarter, is that not helping offset some of the FX, or in other words, the 10 percentage point negative impact from FX will be much higher if that's a 13-week quarter?\\nLuca Maestri: No, I wouldn't say that because those are percentages. So yeah, no, the 10 points wouldn't be different. 13 or 14 weeks would be the same.\\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Thanks a lot Luca.\\nEnd of Q&A:\\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Krish.
